?-ELLA: How's your blog going? -Hmm, fine.
Good.
Very good.
-Written much? -Not a word.
John, it's going to take you a while to adjust to civilian life.
Sure.
And it will help so much to write about everything that's happening to you.
Nothing happens to me.
As far as we can see, no marks on the body.
-No identification.
-Same as the others.
Exactly the same.
(SIGHS) Um, you're not phoning him are you? Because we can handle this.
We can absolutely handle it.
You've got work to do.
This is Inspector Lestrade.
Please call me as soon as you get this.
I think we're going to need you.
John! John Watson! -Stamford.
Mike Stamford.
-Right.
-We were at Bart's together.
-Yes, sorry.
Yes, Mike, hello.
-Yeah, I know, I got fat.
-No I heard you were abroad somewhere getting shot at.
What happened? I got shot.
-So you still at Bart's, then? -Teaching now.
Bright young things, like we used to be.
God, I hate them.
What about you? Staying in town till you get yourself sorted? Can't afford London on an army pension.
I don't know, get yourself a flat-share or something? Who'd want me for a flatmate? (MIKE CHUCKLING) What? Well, you're the second person to say that to me today.
Who was the first? How fresh? Just in.
Sixty-seven, natural causes.
Used to work here, donated his body.
I knew him.
He was nice.
Fine.
We'll start with the riding crop.
So, bad day, was it? (EXHALES) I need to know what bruises form in the next 20 minutes.
A man's alibi depends on it.
Text me.
Listen, I was wondering, maybe later Are you wearing lipstick? You weren't wearing lipstick before.
I just refreshed it a bit.
Sorry, you were saying? I was wondering if you'd like to have coffee? Black, two sugars please, I'll be upstairs.
Okay.
It's a bit different from my day.
You've no idea.
Mike, can I borrow your phone? No signal on mine.
Well, what's wrong with the landline? I'd rather text.
Sorry, other coat.
Oh, here.
Use mine.
Oh.
Thank you.
This is an old mate of mine, John Watson.
Afghanistan or Iraq? Afghanistan.
Sorry, how did you know? Ah, coffee! Thank you, Molly.
What happened to the lipstick? It wasn't working for me.
Really? I thought it was a big improvement.
Mouth's too small now.
Okay.
-How do you feel about the violin? -Sorry, what? I play the violin when I'm thinking.
Sometimes I don't talk for days on end.
Would that bother you? Potential flatmates should know the worst about each other.
-Oh, you told him me about me? -Not a word.
-Then who said anything about flatmates? -I did.
I told Mike this morning that I must be a difficult man to find a flatmate for.
Now here he is after lunch with an old friend clearly home from military service in Afghanistan.
It wasn't a difficult leap.
How did you know about Afghanistan? I've got my eye on a nice little place in central London.
Together we could afford it.
We'll meet there tomorrow evening, 7:00.
Sorry, I've got to dash.
I think I left my riding crop in the mortuary.
-Is that it? -Is that what? We've just met and we're going to go and look at a flat? Problem? We don't know a thing about each other, I don't know your name, I don't even know where we're meeting.
I know you're an army doctor and you've recently been invalided home from Afghanistan.
I know you've got a brother with a bit of money who's worried about you, but you won't go to him for help because you don't approve of him, possibly because he's an alcoholic, more likely because he recently walked out on his wife.
And I know your therapist thinks your limp is psychosomatic, quite correctly, I'm afraid.
That's enough to be going on with, don't you think? The name's Sherlock Holmes and the address is 22 1 B Baker Street.
Afternoon.
Yeah, he's always like that.
Mrs Hudson, our landlady.
-Ah, Mr Holmes.
-Sherlock, please.
Getting a special rate, owes me a favour.
A few years ago her husband got himself sentenced to death in Florida.
I was able to help out.
You stopped her husband being executed? Oh no, I ensured it.
Sherlock! (LAUGHING) Come in, come in.
JOHN: Yep.
Well, this could be very nice.
Very nice, indeed.
Yes, I think so.
My thoughts exactly.
So I went ahead and moved in.
As soon as we get all this rubbish cleaned out.
So, this is all your stuff? Obviously, I can straighten things up a bit.
That's a real skull? Friend of mine.
Well, I say friend.
What do you think, Dr Watson? There's another bedroom upstairs, if you'll be needing two bedrooms.
Well, of course we'll be needing two.
Oh, don't worry, there's all sorts round here.
Mrs Turner, next door, has got married ones.
Sherlock, the mess you've made.
Oh, I, um, looked you up on the Internet last night.
Anything interesting? Found your website.
"The Science of Deduction.
" -What did you think? -Quite amusing, I suppose.
Amusing? You said you could identify a software designer by his tie and, what was it, a retired plumber by his left hand.
Yes, and I can read your military career by your face and your leg, and your brother's drinking habits by your mobile phone.
State of the place already! -How? -You read the article.
The article was absurd.
But I know about his drinking habits.
I even know that he left his wife.
What about these suicides then, Sherlock? Thought that would be right up your street.
Been a fourth one now.
Yes, actually, it's very much up my street.
(TYRES SCREECHING) Can I just ask, what is your street? SHERLOCK: There's been a fifth.
Where this time? Brixton, Lauriston Gardens.
Will you come? -Who's on forensics? -Anderson.
Anderson won't work with me.
He won't be your assistant.
But I need an assistant.
Will you come? Not in a police car.
I'll be right behind.
Thank you.
Oh, brilliant! I thought it was going to be a dull evening.
Honestly, you can't beat a really imaginative serial killer when there's nothing on the telly, Mrs Hudson.
I may be out late, might need some food.
I'm your landlady, dear, not your housekeeper.
SHERLOCK: Something cold will do.
John, make yourself at home.
Er, have a cup of tea, don't wait up.
Look at him dashing about.
My husband was just the same.
But you're more the sitting down type, I can tell.
I'll make you that cuppa, you rest your leg.
-Damn my leg! -(GASPS) Oh.
Sorry, I'm so sorry.
It's just sometimes this bloody thing I understand, dear, I've got a hip.
A cup of tea would be lovely, thank you.
Just this once, dear.
I'm not your housekeeper.
A couple of biscuits, too, if you've got 'em.
Not your housekeeper.
You're a doctor.
In fact, you're an army doctor.
Yes.
Any good? Very good.
Seen a lot of injuries then, violent deaths? Well, yes.
-Bit of trouble too, I bet.
-Of course, yes.
Enough for a lifetime.
Far too much.
-Want to see some more? -God, yes! Come on, then.
Sorry, Mrs Hudson, I'll skip the cuppa.
Off out.
What, both of you? No point sitting at home when there's finally some halfway interesting murders.
Look at you all happy.
It's not decent.
Who cares about decent? The game, Mrs Hudson, is on! Taxi! -Okay, you've got questions.
-Where are we going? Crime scene.
There's been a murder.
Next? -Who are you? What do you do? -What do you think? -I'd say private detective, but -But? The police don't go to private detectives.
I'm a consulting detective.
I'm the only one in the world.
I invented the job.
What does that mean? It means when the police are out of their depth, which is always, they consult me.
But the police don't consultamateurs.
When I met you for the first time yesterday and asked, "Afghanistan or Iraq?" you looked surprised.
-How did you know? -I didn't know, I saw.
Thank you.
SHERLOCK: Tannedface, but no tan above the wrists.
You've been abroad, but not sunbathing.
Your haircut and the way you hold yourself says military.
Your conversation when you entered the room Ah, bit different from my day.
says trained at Bart's.
So army doctor, obvious.
Your limp's really bad when you walk, but you don't ask for a chair when you stand, like you've forgotten about it.
That means the limp is at least partly psychosomatic.
That says the original circumstances of the injury were traumatising.
Wounded in action then.
So, where does an army doctor get himself a suntan and wounded in action these days? Afghanistan or Iraq? You said I had a therapist.
You've got a psychosomatic limp, of course you've got a therapist.
Then there's your brother -Here, use mine.
-Thank you.
Your phone.
It's expensive, e-mail enabled, mp3 player, you're looking for a flat-share, you wouldn't waste money on this.
It's a gift, then.
Scratches, not just one, but many over time.
It's been in the same pocket as keys and coins.
The man sitting beside me wouldn't treat his one luxury item like this, so the previous owner then.
The next bit's easy.
You know it already.
The engraving.
"Harry Watson," clearly a family member who's given you his old phone.
Not your father, this is a young man's gadget.
Could be a cousin, but then you're a war hero returning home who can't find a place to live.
Unlikely you've got an extended family, certainly not one you're close to.
So brother it is.
Now, Clara.
Who's Clara? Three kisses says it's a romantic attachment, the expense of the phone says wife, not girlfriend.
She's given this to him recently, the model is only six months old, so it's a marriage in trouble then.
Six months on, he's just given it away? If she'd left him, he'd have kept the phone, probably.
People do, sentiment.
But no, he wanted rid of it.
He left her.
He gave the phone to you, that says he wants you to stay in touch.
He's worried about you.
You're looking for cheap accommodation, but you won't go to your brother for help.
That says you've got problems with him.
Maybe you liked his wife.
Maybe you don't like his drinking.
Yeah, how can you possibly know about the drinking? Shot in the dark.
Good one, though.
Thank you.
Power connection, tiny scuff marks around the edge of it.
Every night he plugs it into recharge, but his hands are shaking.
You never see those marks on a sober man's phone, you never see a drunk's without them.
There you go, you see, you were right.
I was right? Right about what? The police don't consult amateurs.
That was amazing! -Do you think so? -Of course it was.
It was extraordinary.
It was quite extraordinary.
That's not what people usually say.
-What do they usually say? -Piss off.
Did I get anything wrong? Harry and me don't get on, never have.
Harry and Clara are getting a divorce, split up three months ago.
Harry's a drinker.
Spot on then.
I didn't expect to be right about everything.
Harry is short for Harriet.
Harry's your sister? Now what exactly am I supposed to be doing here? -Your sister.
-No, seriously, why am I here? Oh, there's always something! -Hello, freak.
-I'm here to see Inspector Lestrade.
-Why? -I was invited.
-Why? -I think he wants me to take a look.
-Well, you know what I think, don't you? -Always, Sally.
Even though you didn't make it home last night.
Who's this? Colleague of mine, Dr Watson.
Dr Watson, Sergeant Sally Donovan.
Old friend.
"A colleague?" How did you get a colleague? Did he follow you home? Look, would it be better if I just go No.
Yeah, Freak's here.
Bringing him in.
Ah, Anderson, here we are again.
It's a crime scene.
I don't want it contaminated.
Are we clear on that? Quite clear.
Magic tricks might impress Inspector Lestrade, they don't work on me.
And is your wife away for long? Oh, don't pretend you worked that out.
Someone told you that! SHERLOCK: Your deodorant told me that.
-ANDERSON: My deodorant? -It's for men.
Well, of course it's for men, I'm wearing it! So is Sergeant Donovan.
(SNIFFING) Oh, I think it just vaporised.
May I go in? You listen me, okay? Whatever it is you're trying to imply I'm not implying anything, I'm sure Sally came round for a nice little chat and happened to stay over.
I assume scrubbed your floors, going by the state of her knees.
Right, just Just go in.
Just Just go! (SIGHING) You have two minutes.
I may need longer.
-SHERLOCK: Put this on.
-Who's this? He's with me.
-Yeah, but who is he? -I told you, he's with me.
So, where are we? It's upstairs.
Footprint analysis says that the only other person in this room in the last 1 2 hours was a man of about 5'7", and it seemed that he and the victim arrived together by car.
All identification is missing from the body, just like the others.
Have no idea who she is or where she's from.
Well, she's from out of town, clearly.
Planned to spend a single night in London before returning home.
-So far, so obvious.
-Obvious? Yes, obvious, back of her right leg.
Dr Watson, what do you think? -What do I think? -You're the medical man.
-We have a whole team right outside.
-They won't work with me.
Look, I'm breaking every rule letting you in here.
Yeah, 'cause you need me.
Yes, I do, God help me.
John? Oh, just do as he says, help yourself.
(JOHN GRUNTS) Well? -(SOFTLY) What am I doing here? -Helping me make a point.
I'm supposed to be helping you pay the rent.
-Yeah, this is more fun.
-Fun? There's a woman lying dead.
No, there are two women and three men lying dead.
Keep talking and there'll be more.
Now, cause of death? Asphyxiation, probably.
She passed out and choked on her own vomit.
I can't smell any alcohol on her, could be a seizure, possibly drugs.
It was poison.
-How do you know? -Because they were all poisoned.
-By who? -By themselves.
-Themselves? -We've identified the drug.
Doesn't matter, it was poison.
Same pattern each time.
Each one of them disappears from their normal lives, from the theatre, from their home, from the office, from the pub, and turn up a few hours later, somewhere they've no reason to be, dead.
No marks of violence on the body.
No suggestion of compulsion.
Each of them has taken the same poison, and as far as we can tell, taken it voluntarily.
Sherlock, two minutes, I said.
I need anything you've got.
-Okay, take this down.
-Just tell me what you've got.
-I'm not going to write it down.
-Sherlock! It's all right, I'll do it.
Thank you.
The victim is in her early 30s, professional person.
Going by her clothes, I'd guess something in the media, going by the frankly alarming shade of pink.
She's travelled from Cardiff today, intending to stay in London for one night, that's obvious from the size of her suitcase.
-A suitcase? -A suitcase, yes.
She's been married several years, but not happily.
She's had a string of lovers, but none of them knew she was married.
For God's sake, if you're just making this up Her wedding ring, look at it! It's too tight.
She was thinner when she first wore it, that says married for a while.
Also there's grime in the gem setting.
But the rest of her jewellery has recently been cleaned, that tells you everything you need to know about the state of her marriage.
The inside of the ring is shinier than the outside.
That means it's regularly removed.
The only polishing it gets is when she works it off her finger, but it can't be easy, so she must have a reason.
It can't be for work, her nails are too long.
She doesn't work with her hands, so what, or rather who does she remove her ring for? Clearly not one lover, she'd never sustain the fiction of being single over time.
So more likely a string of them.
Simple.
Brilliant! Sorry.
Cardiff? -Obvious, isn't it? -It's not obvious to me.
Dear God, what's it like inside your funny little brains? It must be so boring.
Her coat is slightly damp.
She's been in heavy rain in the last few hours, no rain anywhere in London until the last few minutes.
Under her coat collar it is damp, too, she's turned it up against the wind.
There's an umbrella in her left pocket, but it's dry and unused.
Not just wind, strong wind.
Too strong to use her umbrella.
We know from the suitcase that she intended to stay a night, so she must have come a decent distance.
But she can't have travelled more than two or three hours because her coat still hasn't dried.
So, where has there been heavy rain and strong winds within the radius of that travel time? Cardiff.
Fantastic! -Do you know you do that out loud? -Sorry, I'll shut up.
No, it's It's fine.
-LESTRADE: There was no suitcase.
-I'm sorry? You keep saying suitcase.
There wasn't one.
Oh.
I was assuming you'd taken it already.
She had a handbag.
Why do you say she had a case? Because she did.
Her handbag, was there a mobile phone in it? No.
That's odd.
That's very odd.
-LESTRADE: Why? -Never mind.
We need to find her case.
How do you know she had a case? Back of her right leg, tiny splash marks above the heel and calf, not present on the left.
She was dragging a wheeled suitcase behind her with her right hand.
You don't get that splash pattern any other way.
Smallish case, judging by the spread.
Case that size, woman this clothes-conscious, could only be an overnight bag.
So we know she was staying a night.
Maybe she checked into a hotel, left her case there? She never made it to a hotel.
Look at her hair.
Colour co-ordinates her lipstick and her shoes.
A woman like that would never leave the hotel with her hair still looking like Oh! Sherlock? What? What is it? What, what, what? Serial killers, always hard.
You have to wait for them to make a mistake.
Well, we can't just wait! Oh, we're done waiting.
When she was found, she couldn't have been here long.
Is that right? No, not long at all, no.
Um, less than an hour.
Less than an hour.
An hour.
News blackout, can you do that? Don't say that you've found her, nothing for a day.
-Why? -Look at her, really look! Houston, we have a mistake! Back in a moment.
What mistake? Pink! -LESTRADE: Anderson! -I'm here.
So, what was the point in all that? We're after a psychopath.
So we're bringing in another psychopath to help? If that's what it takes.
All yours.
Come on, let's get on with it.
-My notes, do you want me to -Sorry, you're Dr Watson.
Well, you're going to have to go, Dr Watson.
Don't need your notes.
LESTRADE: Okay, let's get on with it.
SALLY: Okay, look, we're going to need Jones and Abby -He's gone.
-What, Sherlock Holmes? SALLY: He just took off.
He does that.
-Is he coming back? -SALLY: Didn't look like it.
JOHN: Right.
Right, yes.
Um, sorry, where am I? Brixton.
Right.
Do you know where I'd get a cab? It's just my leg.
Yeah, try the main road.
(SIGHING) -Hey.
-Hmm? You're not his friend, he doesn't have friends, so who are you? Me, I'm I'm nobody.
I've just met him.
Right, bit of advice then.
Stay away from that guy.
-Why? -Well, you know why he's here? He's not paid or anything, he likes it.
He gets off on it.
The weirder the crime, the more he gets off.
And you know what? One day just showing up isn't going to be enough.
One day we'll be standing round a body and Sherlock Holmes will be the one who put it there.
Why would he do that? Because he's a psychopath and psychopaths get bored.
-LESTRADE: Donovan! -Yeah, coming! Stay away from Sherlock Holmes.
-Thanks.
-No worries.
(MOBILE PHONE BEEPING) -You late or something? -No, not particularly, why? Sorry.
You just look a bit wired.
Wired? What do you mean, wired? What are you doing? Nicotine patch, helps me think.
Impossible to sustain a smoking habit in London these days.
Bad news for brain work.
Good news for breathing.
Oh, breathing.
Breathing is boring.
Is that three patches? It's a three patch problem.
Well? You asked me to come.
Took me an hour to get here, I assume it's important.
Oh, yeah, can I borrow your phone? My phone? Don't want to use mine, always a chance the number will be recognised.
It's on the website.
Mrs Hudson's got a phone.
Yeah, but she's downstairs.
I tried shouting, but she didn't hear.
-I was the other side of London! -There was no hurry.
Here, here.
So, what's this about? The case? -Her case.
-Her case? Her suitcase, yes, the murderer took her suitcase.
First big mistake.
It's no use, there's no other way, we'll have to risk it.
Risk what? There's a number, over there on the table.
I want you to send a text.
-Who am I texting? -Never mind.
On the table, the number, now, please! Maybe Sergeant Donovan was right about you.
-What did she say? -Said you were a psychopath.
Oh! Didn't think she was that smart.
She said one day they're going to show up at a murder scene and you'll have provided the body.
These words exactly.
"What happened at Lauriston Gardens? I must have blacked out.
"22 Northumberland Terrace.
Please come.
" Well? Send it.
Have you sent it? Just a moment.
Take a look at the impossible.
The contents of her case.
-How did you get this? -By looking.
Where? We know the killer drove to Lauriston Gardens, we know the killer is a man.
No man could be seen with this case without attracting attention to himself, so obviously he'd feel compelled to get rid of it the moment he knew it was still in his car.
Wouldn't have taken him more than five minutes to realise his mistake.
I checked every back street wide enough for a car within five minutes of Lauriston Gardens and looked for anywhere you could easily dispose of a bulky object without being observed.
It look me less than an hour to find the right skip.
Pink.
You got all that because you realised the case would be pink? Well, it had to be pink, obviously.
-Why didn't I think of that? -Because you're stupid.
Oh, no, don't look like that.
Practically everyone is.
Sent? Sent, yes.
What was that about? The contents of her case, look at them.
-What am I looking for? -The impossible.
One impossible thing.
There's a change of clothes, a make-up bag, a wash-bag and a novel.
-What's impossible? -Her mobile phone.
There isn't a mobile phone.
That's what's impossible.
No mobile in her case, no mobile in her coat pocket.
Well, maybe she doesn't have one.
She has a string of lovers, of course she has one.
She could have left it at home.
Again, string of lovers, she never leaves her phone at home.
And so where is it? You know where it is.
More importantly, you know who has it.
-The murderer? -The murderer.
Who did I just text? Maybe she just dropped it in the back of his car.
Maybe she planted it on purpose to lead us to him, but the murderer has her phone.
(PHONE RINGING) A few hours since his last victim.
Now he's received the text, which can only be from her.
(PHONE CONTINUES RINGING) An innocent man would ignore a text like that, assuming it was a mistake.
A guilty man would panic.
Have you spoken to the police? Five people are dead, there isn't time to talk to the police.
-Then why are you talking to me? -You're here.
-Well? -Well, what? Well, you could sit there and watch telly.
Problem? -Sergeant Donovan.
-What about her? Said you get off on this, you enjoy it.
And I said "danger" and here you are.
Damn it! Where are we going? Northumberland Terrace is a five-minute walk from here.
What, you think he's stupid enough to go there? No, I think he's brilliant enough.
I love the brilliant ones.
They're so desperate to get caught.
-Why? -Appreciation.
At long last the spotlight.
To you it's an arrest, to them it's a coming out party.
That's the frailty of genius, it needs an audience.
Yes.
Yes.
I suppose it does.
22 Northumberland Terrace.
Keep your eyes on it.
-Don't you want to keep your eyes on it? -I am.
Yeah, but he's not just going to ring the doorbell, though, is he? No, of course not, but he'll pass by.
He might even loiter.
Half of London's passing by.
-I'll recognise him.
-You know who he is? -I know what he is.
-Sherlock! Anything on the menu.
Whatever you want, free.
All on the house, you and your date.
-SHERLOCK: Do you want to eat? -I'm not his date.
Oh, oh, this man! He got me off a murder charge.
SHERLOCK: This is Angelo.
Three years ago I successfully proved to Inspector Lestrade that at the time of a particularly vicious triple murder, Angelo was in a completely different part of town, car-jacking.
He cleared my name.
Cleared it a bit.
Anything on the menu, I cook it for you myself.
Thank you, Angelo.
If not for you, I'd have gone to prison.
You did go to prison.
I'll get you a candle for the table.
It's more romantic, hmm? I'm not his date! You may as well eat.
We might be waiting a long time.
Hmm.
Are you going to? -What day is it? -It's Wednesday.
I'm okay for a bit.
You haven't eaten today.
For God's sake, you need to eat! No, you need to eat.
I need to think.
The brain's what counts, everything else is transport.
-You might consider refuelling.
-Hmm.
So, do you have a girlfriend who feeds you up sometimes? Is that what girlfriends do? Feed you up? -You don't have a girlfriend then? -It's not really my area.
Hmm.
Oh.
Oh, right.
Do you have a boyfriend? -Which is fine, by the way.
-I know it's fine.
-So you don't have a boyfriend then? -No.
Right.
Okay.
So unattached, like me.
Good.
John, you should know that I consider myself married to my work and while I'm flattered by your interest, I'm really not looking for any kind of No, no, no.
I wasn't asking you out.
No.
I'm just saying, it's all fine.
Whatever shakes yourboat.
I'm going to shut up now.
I think that's for the best.
So, you don't do anything? Everything else is transport.
No sign yet then? I suppose it is a long shot, we have to be realistic.
You said before you didn't know who the killer was but you knew what.
So do you, if you think about it.
Why don't people just think? Oh, because we're stupid.
We know the killer drove his victims but there were no marks of coercion or violence on the bodies.
Each one of those five people climbed into a stranger's car voluntarily.
The killer was someone they trusted.
But not someone they knew.
Five completely different people, they had no friends in common.
And another thing, Lauriston Gardens, did you see it? Twitching curtains, little old ladies.
Little old ladies, they're my favourite, better than any security cameras.
But according to the police, no one remembers a strange car parked outside an empty house.
Not one person remembered.
I see what you're saying.
No, I don't.
What are you saying? That the killer's got an invisible car? Yes.
Yes, exactly! Then I definitely don't see what you're saying.
(SHERLOCK SIGHING) There are cars that pass like ghosts, unseen, unremembered.
There are people we trust, always, when we're alone, when we're lost, when we're drunk.
We never see their faces, but every day we disappear into their cars and let the trap close around us.
Angelo, glass of white wine, quickly! I give you the perfect murder weapon of the modern age.
The invisible car.
The London cab! There's been cabs up and down this street all night.
-This one's stopped.
-He's looking for a fare.
-But we don't know it's him.
-We don't know it isn't.
Thank you.
Watch.
Don't interfere.
Angelo, headless nun! Oh, now that was a case.
Same again? If you wouldn't mind.
Out of my restaurant! Cretino!You're drunk! (SPEAKING ITALIAN) And stay away! (HORN HONKING) JOHN: What's he doing? ANGELO: Sherlock's on the case.
Bad news for bad people.
(HORN HONKING) Hey, hey, come on! Sorry mate, off duty.
22 1 B Baker Street.
I'm not on duty mate, you see the light? Just round the corner, it's Baker Street! There's plenty of other cabs round here.
Get another cab.
22 1 B! I'm not on duty and I don't do drunks! (PHONE RINGING) Hello? How do you make them take the poison? What? What did you What did you say? I said, how do you make them take the poison? Oi, who are you? Sherlock Holmes.
Do a lot of drugs, Sherlock Holmes? -Not in a while.
-I ask 'cause you're very resilient.
Most people would have passed out by now.
(GRUNTING) It's okay, all part of the plan.
It's okay, he's just had a few.
Look at the state of him! John! John, John! Trouble is, your friends all think you're acting.
That's the thing about people.
(CHUCKLING) They're all stupid.
-Something's gone wrong.
-No, no, no.
All part of the plan.
Sherlock always has a plan.
Yes, and it's gone wrong.
I hope you don't mind.
Well, you gave me your address.
You've only been out for about 1 0 minutes.
You're strong.
I'm impressed.
That's right, you warm yourself up.
I made everything nice and cosy for you.
This is my flat.
Of course it is, yeah.
Found your keys in your jacket.
I thought, well, why not? People like to die at home.
Now, now.
Drug's still in your system.
You'll be weak as a kitten for at least an hour.
I could do anything I wanted to you right now, Mr Holmes.
Anything at all.
But don't worry, I'm only going to kill you.
The whole house is empty.
Even your landlady's away, so there's no point in raising your voice.
We're all locked in, nice and snug.
Still, bit of a risk, isn't it? Here? You call that a risk? This is a risk.
You wanted to know how I made them take the poison.
(LAUGHING) You're going to love this.
How? Take a moment.
Get yourself together.
I want your best game.
My My best what? (SHERLOCK GROANING) I know who you are, Mr Holmes.
The moment you said your name, I knew.
Sherlock Holmes! I've been on your website loads of times.
You are brilliant.
You are.
Proper genius.
"The Science of Deduction.
" Now that is proper thinking.
Between you and me, why can't people think? Doesn't it drive you mad? Why can't people just think? Oh, I see, so you're a proper genius, too.
Don't look it, do I? Funny little man, drives a cab.
But you'll know better in a minute.
Chances are, it'll be the last thing you ever know.
-Who are you? -Nobody.
For now.
But I won't die a nobody.
Now will I? (SIGHING) Two pills.
There's a good pill and a bad pill.
You take the good pill, you live.
-Take the bad pill, you die.
-And you know which is which.
-'Course I know.
-But I don't.
Wouldn't be a game if you knew.
You're the one who chooses.
It's not a game.
It's chance.
I've played five times.
I'm alive.
It's not chance, Mr Holmes, it's chess.
It's a game of chess with one move and one survivor.
And this, this is the move.
Did I just give you the good pill or the bad pill? You can choose either one.
Is this what you did? To all of them? You gave them a choice? You've got to admit, as serial killers go, I'm verging on nice.
Anyway, time's up.
Choose.
And then? And then, together, we take our medicine.
-Let's play.
-Play what? It's a 50/50 chance.
You're not playing the numbers, you're playing me.
Did I just give you the good pill or the bad pill? Is it a bluff? Or a double-bluff? -Or a triple bluff? -It's still chance.
Five people in a row, it's not chance.
-It's luck.
-It's genius.
I know how people think.
I know how people think I think.
I can see it all, like a map in my head.
(SHERLOCK SCOFFS) Everyone's so stupid.
Even you.
'Course, maybe God just loves me.
Either way, you're wasted as a cabbie.
How did you choose which ones? Anyone who didn't know where they were going, 'cause they were drunk or lost or new in town.
Anyone I could walk through the wrong door.
You risked your life five times just to kill strangers? You're dying, aren't you? So are you.
You don't have long, though.
Am I right? Aneurysm, right in here.
Any breath could be my last.
Your only hope, Mr Holmes, bet on the aneurysm.
I'm not a betting man.
Do you think I'm bitter? Well, you have just murdered five people.
I've outlived five people.
That's the most fun you can have with an aneurysm.
(VEHICLE APPROACHING) (TYRES SCREECHING) What if I don't take either? Then I choose for you and I force it down your throat.
Right now, there's nothing you could do to stop me.
Funnily enough, no one's ever gone for that option.
(MOBILE PHONE RINGING) And I don't think you will either.
SHERLOCK: Especially as that's the police.
I know, I'm not blind.
Good old Dr Watson.
I underestimated him.
You make the slightest move towards that phone, I'll kill you.
Oh, I don't think so.
Not your kind of murder.
You want to risk it? Wouldn't you rather risk this? Which one do you think? Which one's the good pill? Come on.
I know you've got a theory.
Oh, interesting.
So what do you think? Shall we? Really, what do you think? Can you beat me? I bet you get bored, don't you? A man like you, so clever.
I bet you're not bored now.
This, this right now, this is what you live for, isn't it? Not being bored.
(SHOT FIRING) (POLICE SIREN APPROACHING) Did anyone see it? Where did it come from? Who is firing? Who is firing? Clear the area! Clear the area now! Why have I got this blanket? They keep putting this blanket on me.
It's for shock.
I'm not in shock.
Yeah, but some of the guys want to take photographs.
(CHUCKLING) So the shooter wasn't one of yours then? God no, we didn't have time.
A guy like that would have had enemies, I suppose, one of them could have been following him.
Whoever it was was gone by the time we got there and we've got nothing to go on.
Oh, I wouldn't say that Okay, give me.
I'll write it down this time.
The bullet they just dug out of my wall was from a hand gun.
A shot clean through the heart over that distance, with that kind of a weapon, that's a crack shot you're looking for.
But not just a marksman, a fighter.
His hand couldn't have shaken at all, so clearly he was acclimatised to violence.
He didn't fire until I was in immediate danger, though, so strong moral principles.
You're looking for a man probably with a history of military service, nerves of steel Actually, do you know what? Ignore me.
I'm sorry? Ignore what I just said, it's the shock talking.
I probably need this blanket.
LESTRADE: Where are you going? Er, I just need to discuss the rent.
Sherlock Were you right? I'm sorry? Did you choose the right pill? I don't know, in all the confusion, I lost track.
I don't know which I chose.
Maybe he beat you.
Maybe, but he's dead.
(CHUCKLES) Sergeant Donovan's been explaining everything to me, it's And the two pills, dreadful business, dreadful.
Where is it? -Where's what? -Don't.
Just don't.
What did you do with the gun? Oh, er, bottom of the Thames.
Uh-huh.
We'll need to get rid of the powder burns on your fingers.
I don't suppose you'd serve time for this, but let's avoid the court case.
I ran after the cab, called the police, of course, and then I thought, better keep an eye on you.
-Are you all right? -Of course I'm all right.
You have just killed a man.
I've seen men die before, and good men, friends of mine.
I thought I'd never sleep again.
I'll sleep fine tonight.
Quite right.
You were going to take the damn pill, weren't you? Of course not, playing for time.
No, you weren't.
That's how you get your kicks, isn't it? Risking your life to prove you're clever.
-Why would I do that? -Because you're an idiot.
Dinner? Starving.
There's a good Chinese, end of the road.
Stays open 'til 2:00.
You can always tell a good Chinese by examining the bottom third of the door handle.
Oi! Sherlock, still got questions for you.
Uh, Inspector Lestrade, to my certain knowledge, this man hasn't eaten for several days.
Now if you want him alive for your next case, what he's going to do right now is have dinner.
And who the hell are you? I'm his doctor.
And only a fool argues with his doctor.
Okay, I'll pull you in tomorrow.
Off you go.
Thank you.
So, ran after a cab.
Told you that limp was psychosomatic.
I knew it was.
-You did get shot, though? -Oh, yeah, in the shoulder.
Oh.
Sherlock! What have you done to my house? Nothing wrong with your house, Mrs Hudson, which is more than can be said for the dead serial killer on the first floor.
Dead what? Good news for London, bad news for your carpet.
Good night, Mrs Hudson.
I'm not your housekeeper! -Night, Mrs Hudson.
-MRS HUDSON: I'm going in.
-LESTRADE: Sergeant Donovan.
-Sir? We'll need those two in tomorrow.
What two, sir? 
How's your blog going? Yeah, good.
Very good.
You haven't written a word, have you? You just wrote "still has trust issues".
And you read my writing upside down.
You see what I mean? John, you're a soldier, and it's going to take you a while to adjust to civilian life, and writing a blog about everything that happens to you will honestly help you.
Nothing happens to me.
What do you mean, there's no ruddy car? He went to Waterloo, I'm sorry.
- Get a cab! - I never get cabs! - I love you.
- When? Get a cab! My husband was a happy man who lived life to the full.
He loved his family and his work, and that he should have taken his own life in this way is a mystery and a shock to all who knew him.
Yes, yes! Taxi! - I'll be back in two minutes, mate.
- What? - I'm just going home to get my umbrella.
- You can share mine.
Two minutes, all right? She still dancing? Yeah, if you can call it that.
- Did you get the car keys off her? - Got them out of her bag.
Where is she? The body of Beth Davenport, Junior Minister for Transport, was found late last night on a building site in Greater London.
Preliminary investigations suggest that this was suicide.
We can confirm that this apparent suicide closely resembles those of Sir Jeffrey Patterson and James Phillimore.
In the light of this, these incidents are now being treated as linked.
The investigation is ongoing, but Detective Inspector Lestrade will take questions now.
Detective Inspector, how can suicides be linked? Well, they all took the same poison.
They were all found in places they had no reason to be.
None of them had shown These three people, there's nothing that links them? There's no link we've found yet, but we're looking for it - there has to be one.
If you've all got texts, - please ignore them.
- It just says "wrong".
Well, just ignore that.
If there are no more questions for Detective Inspector Lestrade, I'm going to bring this session to an end.
If they're suicides, what are you investigating? As I say, these suicides are clearly linked.
It's an unusual situation.
We've got our best people investigating.
- Says "wrong" again.
- One more question.
Is there any chance that these are murders? And if they are, is this the work of a serial killer? I know that you like writing about these, but these do appear to be suicides.
We know the difference.
The poison was clearly self-administered.
Yes, but if they are murders, how do people keep themselves safe? Well, don't commit suicide.
Daily Mail.
Obviously, this is a frightening time for people, but all anyone has to do is exercise reasonable precautions.
We are all as safe as we want to be.
Thank you.
You've got to stop him doing that.
He's making us look like idiots.
If you can tell me how he does it, I'll stop him.
John! John Watson! Stamford, Mike Stamford.
We were at Barts together.
Yes, sorry, yes, Mike, hello.
- Yeah, I know, I got fat.
- No, no.
I heard you were abroad somewhere getting shot at.
What happened? I got shot.
Are you still at Barts, then? Teaching now, yeah.
Bright young things like we used to be.
God, I hate them.
What about you? Just staying in town till you get yourself sorted? I can't afford London on an Army pension.
You couldn't bear to be anywhere else.
That's not the John Watson I know.
Yeah, I'm not the John Watson Couldn't Harry help? Yeah, like that's going to happen I don't know, get a flatshare or something? Come on, who'd want me for a flatmate? What? You're the second person to say that to me today.
Who was the first? How fresh? Just in.
67, natural causes.
Used to work here.
I knew him, he was nice.
Fine.
We'll start with the riding crop.
So, bad day, was it? I need to know what bruises form in the next 20 minutes.
A man's alibi depends on it.
Text me.
Listen, I was wondering.
Maybe later, when you're finished You're wearing lipstick.
You weren't wearing lipstick before.
I, er I refreshed it a bit.
Sorry, you were saying? I was wondering if you'd like to have coffee.
Black, two sugars, please.
I'll be upstairs.
OK.
- Bit different from my day.
- You've no idea! Mike, can I borrow your phone? There's no signal on mine.
- And what's wrong with the landline? - I prefer to text.
Sorry, it's in my coat.
Er, hereuse mine.
Oh, thank you.
This is an old friend of mine, John Watson.
Afghanistan or Iraq? - Sorry? - Which was it, in Afghanistan or Iraq? Afghanistan.
Sorry, how did you? Ah, Molly, coffee, thank you.
What happened to the lipstick? It wasn't working for me.
Really? I thought it was a big improvement.
Your mouth's too small now.
OK.
How do you feel about the violin? I'm sorry, what? I play the violin when I'm thinking and sometimes I don't talk for days on end.
Would that bother you? Potential flatmates should know the worst about each other.
- You told him about me? - Not a word.
Who said anything about flatmates? I did.
Told Mike this morning I must be a difficult man to find a flatmate for.
Now here he is, just after lunch, with an old friend clearly just home from military service in Afghanistan.
- Wasn't a difficult leap.
- How did you know about Afghanistan? Got my eye on a nice little place in central London.
We ought to be able to afford it.
We'll meet there tomorrow evening, seven o'clock.
Sorry, got to dash.
I think I left my riding crop in the mortuary.
Is that it? Is that what? We've only just met and we're going to go and look at a flat? Problem? We don't know a thing about each other.
I don't know where we're meeting.
I don't even know your name.
I know you're an Army doctor and you've been invalided home from Afghanistan.
You've got a brother worried about you, but you won't go to him for help because you don't approve of him, possibly because he's an alcoholic, more likely because he recently walked out on his wife.
And I know your therapist thinks your limp's psychosomatic, quite correctly, I'm afraid.
That's enough to be going on with, don't you think? The name's Sherlock Holmes, and the address is 221B Baker Street.
Afternoon.
He's always like that.
Hello.
- Ah, Mr Holmes.
- Sherlock, please.
Well, this is a prime spot.
Must be expensive.
Mrs Hudson, the landlady - she's given me a special deal.
Owes me a favour.
A few years back, her husband got himself sentenced to death in Florida.
I was able to help out.
Sorry, you stopped her husband being executed? Oh, no, I ensured it.
Sherlock! Mrs Hudson, Dr John Watson.
- Hello.
Come in.
- Thank you.
Shall we? Well, this could be very nice.
Very nice indeed.
Yes.
Yes, I think so, my thoughts precisely.
- So I went straight ahead and moved in.
- Soon as we get this rubbish cleaned up.
Oh.
So this is all Well, obviously I can straighten things up a bit.
- That's a skull.
- Friend of mine.
When I say friend What do you think, then, Dr Watson? There's another bedroom upstairs, if you'll be needing two bedrooms.
Of course we'll be needing two.
Oh, don't worry, there's all sorts round here.
Mrs Turner next door's got married ones.
OhSherlock! The mess you've made.
I looked you up on the internet last night.
Anything interesting? Found your website.
The Science Of Deduction.
What did you think? You said you could identify a software designer by his tie and an airline pilot by his left thumb? Yes.
And I can read your military career in your face and your leg, and your brother's drinking habits in your mobile phone.
How? What about these suicides, then, Sherlock? I thought that'd be right up your street.
Three exactly the same.
Four.
There's been a fourth.
And there's something different - this time.
- A fourth? - Where? - Brixton, Lauriston Gardens.
What's new about this one? You wouldn't have come to me otherwise.
You know how they never leave notes? This one did.
- Will you come? - Who's on forensics? - Anderson.
- He doesn't work well with me.
- Well, he won't be your assistant.
- I need an assistant.
Will you come? Not in a police car, I'll be right behind.
Thank you.
Brilliant! Yes! Four serial suicides and now a note.
Oh, it's Christmas.
Mrs Hudson, I'll be late.
Might need some food.
I'm your landlady, dear, not your housekeeper.
Something cold will do.
John, have a cup of tea, make yourself at home.
Don't wait up! Look at him, dashing about My husband was just the same.
But you're more the sitting-down type, I can tell.
I'll make you that cuppa, you rest your leg.
Damn my leg! Sorry, I'm so sorry.
It's just sometimes this bloody thing I understand, dear, I've got a hip.
Cup of tea'd be lovely.
Thank you.
Just this once, dear, I'm not your housekeeper.
Couple of biscuits too, if you've got 'em.
Not your housekeeper! You're a doctor.
In fact, you're an Army doctor.
Yes.
Any good? Very good.
Seen a lot of injuries, then.
Violent deaths.
Well, yes.
Bit of trouble too, I bet? Of course.
Yes.
Enough for a lifetime, far too much.
- Want to see some more? - Oh, God, yes.
Sorry, Mrs Hudson, I'll skip the tea.
Off out.
- Both of you? - Impossible suicides? Four of them? No point sitting at home when there's finally something fun going on! - Look at you, all happy.
It's not decent.
- Who cares about decent? The game, Mrs Hudson, is on! Taxi! - OK, you've got questions - Yeah, where are we going? Crime scene.
Next? - Who are you? What do you do? - What do you think? - I'd sayprivate detective.
- But? But the police don't go to private detectives.
I'm a consulting detective.
Only one in the world.
I invented the job.
What does that mean? It means when the police are out of their depth, which is always, - they consult me.
- The police don't consult amateurs.
When I met you for the first time yesterday, I said Afghanistan or Iraq.
- You looked surprised.
- Yes, how did you know? I didn't know, I saw.
Your haircut, the way you hold yourself says military.
But your conversation Bit different from my day.
said trained at Barts - so Army doctor, obvious.
Your face is tanned but no tan above the wrists.
You've been abroad, but not sunbathing.
Your limp's bad when you walk, but you don't ask for a chair when you stand, like you've forgotten about it, so it's at least partly psychosomatic.
That says the original circumstances of the injury were traumatic.
Wounded in action, then.
Wounded in action, suntan - Afghanistan or Iraq.
You said I had a therapist.
You've got a psychosomatic limp, of course you've got a therapist.
Then there's your brother.
Your phone.
It's expensive, e-mail enabled, MP3 player.
You're looking for a flatshare.
You wouldn't buy this - it's a gift.
Scratches.
Not one, many over time - it's been in the same pocket as keys and coins.
You wouldn't treat your one luxury item like this, so it's had a previous owner.
Next bit's easy.
You know it already.
The engraving? Harry Watson.
Clearly a family member who's given you his old phone.
Not your father, this is a young man's gadget.
Could be a cousin, but you're a war hero who can't find a place to live.
Unlikely you've got an extended family, not one you're close to.
So brother it is.
Now, who's Clara? Three kisses says it's a romantic attachment.
The expense of the phone says wife, not girlfriend.
Must have given it to him recently, the model's only six months old.
Marriage in trouble, then - six months on he's given it away.
If she'd left him, he would have kept it.
Sentiment.
No, he wanted rid of it.
He left her.
He gave the phone to you, so he wants you to stay in touch.
You're looking for cheap accommodation, but not going to your brother for help.
That says you've got problems with him.
Maybe you liked his wife or don't like his drinking.
How can you possibly know about the drinking? Shot in the dark.
Good one, though.
Power connection - tiny little scuff marks round the edge.
Every night he plugs it in to charge, but his hands are shaking.
You never see those marks on a sober man's phone, never see a drunk's without them.
There you go, you were right.
I was right? Right about what? The police don't consult amateurs.
Thatwas amazing.
- Do you think so? - Of course it was.
It was extraordinary, quite extraordinary.
- That's not what people normally say.
- What do people normally say? Piss off! Did I get anything wrong? Harry and me don't get on, never have.
Clara and Harry split up three months ago and they're getting a divorce.
And Harry is a drinker.
Spot on, then.
I didn't expect to be right about everything.
Harry's short for Harriet.
Harry's your sister.
What exactly am I supposed to be doing here? - Sister! - No, seriously, what am I doing here? There's always something.
Hello, freak! I'm here to see Detective Inspector Lestrade.
- Why? - I was invited.
- Why? - I think he wants me to take a look.
- You know what I think, don't you? - Always, Sally.
I even know you didn't make it home last night.
- Erwho's this? - Colleague of mine, Dr Watson.
Dr Watson, Sergeant Sally Donovan.
Old friend.
A colleague? How do you get a colleague? Did he follow you home? - Would it be better if I just waited? - No.
Freak's here.
Bringing him in.
Ah, Anderson.
Here we are again.
It's a crime scene.
I don't want it contaminated.
Are we clear on that? Quite clear.
And is your wife away for long? Oh, don't pretend you worked that out.
Somebody told you that.
Your deodorant told me that.
- My deodorant? - It's for men.
Well, of course it's for men - I'm wearing it.
So's Sergeant Donovan.
OohI think it just vaporised.
May I go in? Whatever you're trying to imply I'm not implying anything.
I'm sure Sally came round for a nice little chat and just happened to stay over.
And I assume she scrubbed your floors, going by the state of her knees.
You'll need to wear one of these.
Who's this? He's with me.
- But who is he? - I said he's with me.
Aren't you going to put one on? - So where are we? - Upstairs.
I can give you two minutes.
May need longer.
Her name's Jennifer Wilson, according to her credit cards.
We're running them now for contact details.
Hasn't been here long.
Some kids found her.
Shut up.
- I didn't say anything.
- You were thinking.
It's annoying.
Got anything? Not much.
She's German.
Rache.
It's German for revenge.
- She could be trying to tell us - Yes, thank you for your input.
- So she's German? - Of course she's not.
She's from out of town, though.
Intended to stay in London for one night before returning home to Cardiff - so far, so obvious.
- Sorry, obvious? - What about the message, though? Dr Watson, what do you think? - Of the message? - Of the body.
You're a medical man.
- We have a whole team outside.
- They won't work with me.
I'm breaking every rule letting you in here Yes, because you need me.
Yes, I do.
God help me.
- Dr Watson! - Hm? Oh, do as he says.
Help yourself.
Anderson, keep everyone out for a couple of minutes - Well? - What am I doing here? - Helping me make a point.
- I'm supposed to help you pay the rent.
- This is more fun.
- Fun? There's a woman lying dead.
Perfectly sound analysis, but I was hoping you'd go deeper.
Yeah Asphyxiationprobably.
Passed out, choked on her own vomit.
Can't smell any alcohol on her.
It could have been a seizure.
Possibly drugs.
You know what it was, you've read the papers.
Well, she's one of the suicides.
The fourth? Sherlock, two minutes, I said.
I need anything you've got.
Victim is in her late 30s.
Professional person, going by her clothes.
I'm guessing the media, going by the frankly alarming shade of pink.
Traveled from Cardiff today, intending to stay in London for one night from the size of her suitcase.
- Suitcase? - Yes.
She's been married at least ten years, but not happily.
She's had a string of lovers, but none of them knew she was married.
Oh, for God's sake, if you're just making this up Her wedding ring.
Ten years old at least.
The rest of her jewellery has been regularly cleaned, but not her wedding ring.
State of her marriage right there.
The inside is shinier than the outside, so it's regularly removed.
The only polishing it gets is when she works it off her finger.
It's not for work, look at her nails.
She doesn't work with her hands, so what or who does she remove her rings for? Not one lover, she'd never sustain the fiction of being single for that long, - so more likely a string of them.
Simple.
- That's brilliant.
- Sorry.
- Cardiff? - It's obvious, isn't it? - It's not obvious to me.
Dear God, what is it like in your funny little brains? It must be so boring.
Her coat - it's slightly damp, she's been in heavy rain in the last few hours - no rain anywhere in London in that time.
Under her coat collar is damp too.
She's turned it up against the wind.
She's got an umbrella in her pocket, but it's dry and unused.
Not just wind, strong wind - too strong to use her umbrella.
We know from her suitcase that she was intending to stay overnight, but she can't have traveled more than two or three hours, because her coat still hasn't dried.
So, where has there been heavy rain and strong wind within the radius of that travel time? Cardiff.
- That's fantastic.
- Do you know you do that out loud? - Sorry, I'll shut up.
- No, it'sfine.
- Why do you keep saying suitcase? - Yes, where is it? She must have had a phone or an organizer.
Find out who Rachel is.
She was writing Rachel? No, she was leaving an angry note in German! Of course she was writing Rachel, no other word it can be.
But why did she wait until she was dying to write it? How do you know she had a suitcase? Tiny splash marks on her right heel and calf not present on the left.
She was dragging a wheeled suitcase behind her with her right hand.
Don't get that splash pattern any other way.
Smallish case, going by the spread.
Case that size, woman this clothes-conscious - could only be an overnight bag so we know she was staying one night.
Where is it? What have you done with it? There wasn't a case.
- Say that again.
- There wasn't a case.
There was never any suitcase.
Suitcase! Did anyone find a suitcase? Was there a suitcase in this house? Sherlock, there was no case! But they take the poison themselves, they swallow the pills.
There are clear signs, even you lot couldn't miss them.
Right, thanks.
And? It's murder, all of them.
I don't know how.
But they're not suicides, they're serial killings.
We've got a serial killer.
Love those.
There's always something to look forward to.
- Why are you saying that? - Her case! Come on, where is her case? Did she eat it Someone else was here and they took her case.
So the killer must have driven here.
Forgot the case was in the car.
She could have checked into a hotel, left it there.
No, she never got to the hotel.
Look at her hair.
She colour-coordinates her lipstick and shoes.
She'd never have left any hotel with her hair still looking Oh Oh! Sherlock? What is it, what? Serial killers, always hard.
You have to wait for them to make a mistake.
- We can't just wait! - Oh, we're done waiting.
Look at her, really look! Houston, we have a mistake.
Get on to Cardiff.
Find out who Jennifer Wilson's family and friends were.
Find Rachel! Of course, yeah - but what mistake?! Pink! Let's get on with it - He's gone.
- Who, Sherlock Holmes? Yeah, he just took off.
He does that.
- Is he coming back? - Didn't look like it.
Right.
Right Yes.
Sorry, where am I? Brixton.
Do you know where I could get a cab? It's just, er well my leg.
Er try the main road.
Thanks.
But you're not his friend.
He doesn't have friends.
So who are you? I'mI'm nobody.
I just met him.
OK, bit of advice, then.
Stay away from that guy.
Why? You know why he's here? He's not paid or anything.
He likes it.
He gets off on it.
The weirder the crime, the more he gets off.
And you know what? One day just showing up won't be enough.
One day we'll be standing round a body, and he'll be the one that put it there.
- Why would he do that? - Because he's a psychopath.
Psychopaths get bored.
- Donovan! - Coming.
Stay away from Sherlock Holmes.
Taxi! Taxi Hello? There is a security camera on the building to your left.
Do you see it? Who's this? Who's speaking? Do you see the camera, Dr Watson? - Yeah, I see it.
- Watch There is another camera on the building opposite you.
Do you see it? Mm-hm.
And finally, at the top of the building on your right.
How are you doing this? Get into the car, Dr Watson.
I would make some sort of threat, but I'm sure your situation is quite clear to you.
- Hello.
- Hi.
What's your name, then? ErAnthea.
- Is that your real name? - No.
I'm John.
Yes.
I know.
Any point in askingwhere I'm going? None at all John.
OK.
Have a seat, John.
You know, I've got a phone.
I mean, very clever and all that, but, er you could just phone me.
On my phone.
When one is avoiding the attention of Sherlock Holmes, one learns to be discreet, hence this place.
Your leg must be hurting you.
Sit down.
I don't want to sit down.
You don't seem very afraid.
You don't seem very frightening.
Yes The bravery of the soldier.
Bravery is by far the kindest word for stupidity, don't you think? What is your connection to Sherlock Holmes? I don't have one.
I barely know him.
I met himyesterday.
Mmm, and since yesterday, you've moved in with him and now you're solving crimes together.
Might we expect a happy announcement by the end of the week? - Who are you? - An interested party.
Interested in Sherlock? Why? I'm guessing you're not friends.
You've met him.
How many friends do you imagine he has? I am the closest thing to a friend that Sherlock Holmes is capable of having.
- And what's that? - An enemy.
- An enemy? - In his mind, certainly.
If you were to ask him, he'd probably say his arch-enemy.
He does love to be dramatic.
Well, thank God you're above all that I hope I'm not distracting you.
Not distracting me at all.
Do you plan to continue your association with Sherlock Holmes? I could be wrong but I think that's none of your business.
- It could be.
- It really couldn't.
If you do move into, um 221B Baker Street, I'd be happy to pay you a meaningful sum of money on a regular basis to ease your way.
- Why? - Because you're not a wealthy man.
In exchange for what? Information.
Nothing indiscreet.
Nothing you'd feeluncomfortable with.
- Just tell me what he's up to.
- Why? I worry about him.
Constantly.
That's nice of you.
But I would prefer for various reasons that my concern go unmentioned.
We have what you might call a difficult relationship.
- No.
- But I haven't mentioned a figure.
- Don't bother.
- You're very loyal very quickly.
No, I'm not, I'm just not interested.
"Trust issues", it says here.
What's that? Could it be that you've decided to trust Sherlock Holmes of all people? Who says I trust him? You don't seem the kind to make friends easily.
- Are we done? - You tell me.
I imagine people have already warned you to stay away from him, but I can see from your left hand that's not going to happen.
- My what? - Show me.
Don't - Remarkable.
- What is? Most people blunder round this city and all they see are streets and shops and cars.
When you walk with Sherlock Holmes, you see the battlefield.
You've seen it already, haven't you? What's wrong with my hand? You have an intermittent tremor in your left hand.
Your therapist thinks it's post-traumatic stress disorder.
She thinks you're haunted by memories of your military service.
Who the hell are you? - How do you know that? - Fire her.
She's got it the wrong way round.
You're under stress right now, and your hand is perfectly steady.
You're not haunted by the war, Dr Watson You miss it.
Welcome back.
Time to choose a side, Dr Watson.
I'm to take you home.
Address? Er, Baker Street.
221B Baker Street.
But I need to stop off somewhere first.
Listen, your boss.
Any chance you could not tell him this is where I went? - Sure.
- You've told him already, haven't you? Yeah.
Hey, um do you ever get any free time? Oh, yeah.
Lots.
- Bye.
- OK.
- What are you doing? - Nicotine patch.
Helps me think.
Impossible to sustain a smoking habit in London these days.
Bad news for brain work.
- It's good news for breathing.
- Oh, breathing! Breathing's boring.
Is thatthree patches? It's a three-patch problem.
Well? You asked me to come, I'm assuming it's important.
Oh, yeah, of course.
Can I borrow your phone? My phone? Always a chance that my number will be recognised.
It's on the website.
Mrs Hudson's got a phone.
She's downstairs.
I shouted, but she didn't hear.
- I was the other side of London - There was no hurry.
Here So what's this about - the case? - Her case - Her case? Her suitcase, yes, obviously.
The murderer took her suitcase, first big mistake.
OK, he took her case.
So? It's no use, there's no other way.
We'll have to risk it.
On my desk there's a number.
I want you to send a text.
You've brought me here to send a text.
Text, yes.
The number on my desk.
- What's wrong? - Just met a friend of yours.
- A friend? - An enemy.
Oh.
Which one? Well, your arch-enemy, according to him.
Do people have arch-enemies? Did he offer you money to spy on me? - Yes.
- Did you take it? - No.
- Pity, we could have split the fee.
- Think it through next time.
- Who is he? The most dangerous man you've ever met and not my problem right now.
On my desk, the number! Jennifer Wilson.
That was Hang on.
Wasn't that the dead woman? Yes.
That's not important.
Just enter the number.
- Are you doing it? - Yes.
- Have you done it? - Yeah, hang on! These words exactly.
"What happened at Lauriston Gardens? "I must have blacked out.
"22 Northumberland Street, please come.
" - You blacked out? - What? No No! Type and send it.
Quickly.
- Have you sent it? - What's the address? 22 Northumberland Street.
Hurry up! That's That's the pink lady's case, that's Jennifer Wilson's case.
Yes, obviously.
Oh, perhaps I should mention - I didn't kill her.
- I never said you did.
- Why not? Given that text and the fact I have her case, it's a perfectly logical assumption.
Do people usually assume you're the murderer? Now and then, yes.
OK - How did you get this? - By looking.
Where? The killer must have driven her to Lauriston Gardens.
He could only keep her case by accident if it was in a car.
Nobody could be seen with this case without drawing attention - particularly a man, which is statistically more likely.
So obviously he'd feel compelled to get rid of it.
Wouldn't have taken him more than five minutes to realise his mistake.
I checked every backstreet wide enough for a car five minutes from Lauriston Gardens and anywhere you could dispose of a bulky object without being observed.
Took me less than an hour to find the right skip.
Pink.
You got all that because you realised the case would be pink? - It had to be pink, obviously.
- Why didn't I think of that Because you're an idiot.
No, no, don't look like that.
Practically everyone is.
Now, look.
Do you see what's missing? From the case? How could I? Her phone.
Where's her mobile phone? There was no phone on the body, there's no phone in the case.
We know she had one.
You just texted it.
Maybe she left it at home.
She has a string of lovers and she's careful about it.
She never leaves her phone at home.
Er Why did I just send that text? Well, the question is where is her phone now? - She could have lost it.
- Yes, or? The murderer You think the murderer has the phone? Maybe sheleft it when she left her case.
Maybe he took it from her for some reason.
Either way, the balance of probability is the murderer has her phone.
Sorrywhat are we doing? Did I just text a murderer? What good will that do? A few hours after his last victim, and now he receives a text that can only be from her.
If somebody had just found that phone, they'd ignore a text like that, but the murderer would panic.
- Have you talked to the police? - Four people are dead, there isn't time.
So why are you talking to me? Mrs Hudson took my skull.
So I'm basically filling in for your skull? Relax, you're doing fine.
- Well? - Well, what? Wellyou could just sit there andwatch telly.
You want me to come with you? I like company when I go out and I think better when I talk aloud.
The skull just attracts attention, so - Problem? - Yeah, Sergeant Donovan.
What about her? She said you get off on this, you enjoy it.
And I said "dangerous", and here you are.
Damn it! Where are we going? Northumberland Street's a five-minute walk from here.
You think he's stupid enough to go there? No, I think he's brilliant enough.
I love the brilliant ones.
They're all so desperate to get caught.
- Why? - Appreciation! Applause! At long last the spotlight.
That's the frailty of genius, John, - it needs an audience.
- Yeah.
This is his hunting ground.
Right here in the heart of the city.
Now that we know his victims were abducted, that changes everything.
Because all of his victims disappeared from busy streets, crowded places, but nobody saw them go.
Think! Who do we trust, even though we don't know them? Who passes unnoticed wherever they go? Who hunts in the middle of a crowd? Don't know.
Who? Haven't the faintest.
Hungry? Thank you, Billy.
22 Northumberland Street.
Keep your eyes on it.
He's not just going to ring the doorbell.
He'd need to be mad.
He has killed four people.
OK.
Sherlock! Anything on the menu, whatever you want, free.
On the house, for you and for your date.
- Do you want to eat? - I'm not his date.
This man got me off a murder charge.
This is Angelo.
Three years ago, I proved to Lestrade, at the time of a particularly vicious triple murder, that Angelo was in a different part of town, house-breaking.
- He cleared my name.
- I cleared it a bit.
Anything happening opposite? Nothing.
But for this man, I'd have gone to prison.
- You did go to prison.
- I'll get a candle for the table.
- It's more romantic.
- I'm not his date! You may as well eat.
We might have a long wait.
Thanks.
People don't have arch-enemies.
- I'm sorry? - In real life.
There are no arch-enemies in real life.
Doesn't happen.
Doesn't it? Sounds a bit dull.
So who did I meet? What do real people have, then, in their"real lives"? Friends? People they know, people they like, people they don't like - Girlfriends, boyfriends.
- Yes, well, as I was saying, dull.
You don't have a girlfriend, then? Girlfriend? No, not really my area.
Mm.
Oh, right.
Do you have a boyfriend? Which is fine, by the way.
I know it's fine.
- So you've got a boyfriend, then.
- No.
Right.
OK.
You're unattached.
Like me.
Fine.
Good.
John, umI think you should know I consider myself married to my work and while I'm flattered, - I'm really not looking for any - No, I'mnot asking.
No.
I'm just saying, it's all fine.
Good.
Thank you.
Look across the street.
Taxi.
It's stopped.
Nobody getting in and nobody getting out.
Why a taxi? Oh, that's clever.
- Is it clever? Why is it clever? - That's him.
- Don't stare.
- You're staring.
We can't both stare.
Sorry - I've got the cab number.
- Good for you.
Right turn, one way, roadworks, traffic lights, bus lane, pedestrian crossing, left turn only, traffic lights.
- Oi! - Sorry.
Come on, John Come on, John.
We're losing him! This way.
- No, this way! - Sorry Police! Open her up.
No Teeth, tan.
What, Californian? LA, Santa Monica.
Just arrived.
- How could you possibly know that? - The luggage.
First trip to London, right? Going by your final destination and the cabbie's route.
Sorry, are you guys the police? Yeah.
Everything all right? Yeah.
Welcome to London.
Er, any problems, just let us know.
Basically just a cab that happened to slow down.
- Basically.
- Not the murderer.
- Not the murderer, no.
- Wrong country, good alibi.
- As they go.
- Hey, where did you get this? - Detective Inspector Lestrade? - Yeah.
I pickpocket him when he's annoying.
You can keep that one, I've got plenty at the flat.
- What? - Nothing, just"Welcome to London.
" - Got your breath back? - Ready when you are.
That was ridiculous.
That was the most ridiculous thing I've ever done.
And you invaded Afghanistan.
That wasn't just me.
Why aren't we back at the restaurant? They can keep an eye out.
It was a long shot anyway.
So what were we doing there? Oh, just passing the time.
And proving a point.
- What point? - You.
Mrs Hudson! Dr Watson will take the room upstairs.
Says who? Says the man at the door.
Sherlock texted me.
He said you forgot this.
Ah Er, thank you.
Thank you.
Sherlock, what have you done? - Mrs Hudson? - Upstairs.
What are you doing? I knew you'd find the case, I'm not stupid.
You can't just break into my flat.
You can't withhold evidence - and I didn't break in.
What do you call this, then? It's a drugs bust.
Seriously? This guy - a junkie? - Have you met him? - John You could search this flat all day, you wouldn't find anything you could call recreational.
- John, you probably want to shut up now.
- But come on - No - What? - You? - Shut up! - I'm not your sniffer dog.
- No, Anderson's my sniffer dog.
Anderson, what are you doing here on a drugs bust? - Oh, I volunteered.
- They all did.
They're not strictly speaking on the drug squad, but they're very keen.
- Are these human eyes? - Put those back! - They were in the microwave.
- It's an experiment.
Keep looking, guys.
Or you could help us properly, and I'll stand them down.
- This is childish.
- Well, I'm dealing with a child.
Sherlock, this is our case.
I'm letting you in, but you do not go off on your own.
Clear? So you set up a pretend drugs bust to bully me? It stops being pretend if we find anything.
I am clean! - Is your flat? All of it? - I don't even smoke.
Neither do I.
So let's work together.
- We've found Rachel.
- Who is she? Jennifer Wilson's only daughter.
Her daughter? Why would she write her daughter's name? Why? Never mind that, we found the case.
According to someone, the murderer has the case, and we found it in the hands of our favourite psychopath.
Not a psychopath, I'm a high-functioning sociopath.
Do your research.
You need to bring Rachel in to question her.
I need to question her.
She's dead.
Excellent.
How, when and why? Is there a connection? There has to be.
Well, I doubt it, since she's been dead for 1 4 years.
Technically, she was never alive.
Rachel was Jennifer Wilson's stillborn daughter, 1 4 years ago.
Oh, that's that's not right.
How Why would she do that? Why? Why would she think of her daughter in her last moments? Yep - sociopath, I'm seeing it now.
She didn't think about her daughter.
She scratched her name on the floor with her fingernails.
She was dying.
It took effort, it would have hurt.
You said that the victims all took the poison themselves, that he makes them take it.
Well, maybe heI don't know, talks to them.
Maybe he used the death of her daughter somehow.
But that was ages ago.
Why would she still be upset? Not good? Bit not good, yeah.
If you were dying, if you'd been murdered, in your very last few seconds, what would you say? - "Please, God, let me live.
" - Use your imagination! I don't have to.
Yeah, but if you were clever, really clever.
Jennifer Wilson running all those lovers - she was clever.
She's trying to tell us something.
Isn't the doorbell working? Your taxi's here, Sherlock.
- I didn't order a taxi.
Go away.
- Oh, dear.
They're making such a mess.
- What are they looking for? - It's a drugs bust, Mrs Hudson.
But they're just for my hip.
They're herbal soothers Shut up, everybody! Don't move, don't speak, don't breathe.
I'm trying to think.
Anderson, face the other way.
You're putting me off.
- What? My face is - Everybody quiet and still.
- Anderson, turn your back.
- Oh, for God's sake! Your back, now, please! - Come on, think.
Quick! - What about your taxi? Mrs Hudson! Oh Ah! She was clever.
Clever, yes! She's cleverer than you lot and she's dead.
Do you see? Do you get it? She didn't lose her phone, she never lost it.
She planted it on him.
When she got out of the car, she knew that she was going to her death.
She left the phone in order to lead us to her killer.
- But how? - What do you mean, how? Rachel! Don't you see? Rachel! Oh Look at you lot.
You're all so vacant.
Is it nice not being me? It must be so relaxing.
- Rachel is not a name.
- Then what is it? John, on the luggage, there's a label.
E-mail address.
Er, jenny.
pink@mephone.
org.
uk.
She didn't have a laptop, which means she did her business on her phone.
So it's a smartphone, it's e-mail enabled.
So there was a website for her account.
The username is her e-mail address, and all together now, the password is? - Rachel.
- So we can read her e-mails.
So what? Anderson, don't talk out loud.
You lower the IQ of the whole street.
We can do much more than that.
It's a smartphone, it's got GPS.
Which means if you lose it, you can locate it online.
She's leading us to the man who killed her.
- Unless he got rid of it.
- We know he didn't.
- Come on, come on.
Quickly! - Sherlock, dear.
This taxi driver Mrs Hudson, isn't it time for your evening soother? Get vehicles, get a helicopter.
This phone battery won't last for ever.
We'll just have a map reference, not a name.
It's a start! Sherlock Narrows it down from just anyone in London.
- It's the first proper lead we've had.
- Sherlock Where is it? Quickly, where? Here.
It'sin 22 1 Baker Street.
How can it be here? How? Maybe it was in the case when you brought it back - and it fell out somewhere.
- And I didn't notice it? I didn't notice? Anyway, we texted him, and he called back.
Guys, we're also looking for a mobile somewhere here, belonged to the victim.
Who do we trust, even if we don't know them? Who passes unnoticed wherever they go? Who hunts in the middle of a crowd? - Sherlock, are you OK? - What? Yeah, yeah I'm fine.
So, how can the phone be here? Don't know.
- I'll try it again.
- Good idea.
Where are you going? Fresh air, just popping outside for a moment.
Won't be long.
- Are you sure you're all right? - I'm fine.
Taxi for Sherlock Holmes.
I didn't order a taxi.
Doesn't mean you don't need one.
You're the cabbie.
The one who stopped outside Northumberland Street.
It was you.
Not your passenger.
See? No-one ever thinks about the cabbie.
It's like you're invisible.
Just the back of an 'ead.
Proper advantage for a serial killer.
- Is this a confession? - Oh, yeah.
I'll tell you what else If you call the coppers now, I won't run.
I'll sit quiet, and they can take me down, I promise.
Why? - Cos you're not going to do that.
- Am I not? I didn't kill those four people, Mr Holmes.
I spoke to 'em and they killed themselves.
If you get the coppers now, I'll promise you one thing.
I will never tell you what I said.
No-one else will die, though, and I believe they call that a result.
And you won't ever understand how those people died.
What kind of result do you care about? If I wanted to understand - what would I do? - Let me take you for a ride.
- So you can kill me too? - I don't want to kill you, Mr Holmes.
I'm going to talk to you and then you're going to kill yourself.
He just got in a cab It's Sherlock.
He just drove off in a cab.
I told you, he does that.
He bloody left again.
We're wasting our time! I'mcalling the phone, it's ringing out.
And if it's ringing, it's not here.
- I'll try the search again.
- Does it matter? Does any of it? He's just a lunatic and he'll always let you down.
And you're wasting your time.
All our time.
OK, everybody done here.
How did you find me? Oh, I recognised you.
Soon as I saw you chasing my cab.
Sherlock Holmes! I was warned about you.
I've been on your website too.
Brilliant stuff! Loved it.
Who warned you about me? Just someone out there who's noticed.
Who? Who would notice me? - You're too modest, Mr Holmes.
- I'm really not.
Got yourself a fan.
Tell me more.
That's all you're going to know.
In this lifetime.
Why did he do that? Why did he have to leave? You know him better than I do.
I've known him for five years and, no, I don't.
So why do you put up with him? Because I'm desperate, that's why.
And because Sherlock Holmes is a great man, and I think one day, if we're very, very lucky, he might even be a good one.
Where are we? You know every street in London.
You know exactly where we are.
Roland-Kerr Further Education College.
- Why here? - It's open.
Cleaners are in.
One thing about being a cabbie - you always know a nice quiet spot for a murder.
I'm surprised more of us don't branch out.
And you just walk your victims in? How? Oh Dull.
Don't worry.
It gets better.
You can't make people take their own lives at gunpoint.
I don't.
It's much better than that.
Don't need this with you.
Cos you'll follow me.
Well, what do you think? It's up to you.
You're the one who's going to die here.
No, I'm not.
That's what they all say.
Shall we talk? Bit risky, wasn't it? Took me away under the eye of about half a dozen policemen.
They're not that stupid.
And Mrs Hudson will remember you.
You call that a risk? Nah Thisis a risk.
Oh, I like this bit.
Cos you don't get it yet, do ya? But you're about to.
I just have to do this Weren't expecting that, were ya? Oh, you're gonna love this.
- Love what? - Sherlock Holmeslook at you! Here in the flesh.
That website of yours, your fan told me about it.
My fan? You are brilliant.
You are a proper genius.
The Science Of Deduction.
Now, that is proper thinking.
Between you and me sitting here, why can't people think? Don't it make you mad? Why can't people just think? Oh, I see So you're a proper genius too.
Don't look it, do I? Funny little man driving a cab.
But you'll know better in a minute.
Chances are it'll be the last thing you ever know.
OK, two bottles.
Explain.
There's a good bottle and a bad bottle.
You take the pill from the good bottle, you live.
You take the pill from the bad bottleyou die.
- Both bottles are of course identical.
- In every way.
- And you know which is which.
- Of course I know.
- But I don't.
- Wouldn't be a game if you knew - you're the one who chooses.
Why should I? I've got nothing to go on.
What's in it for me? I haven't told you the best bit yet.
Whatever bottle you choose, I take the pill from the other one.
And then together we take our medicine.
I won't cheat.
It's your choice.
I'll take whatever pill you don't.
Didn't expect that, did you, Mr Holmes? This is what you did to the rest of them, - you gave them a choice? - And now I'm giving you one.
You take your time.
Get yourself together.
- I want your best game.
- It's not a game, it's chance.
I've played four times.
I'm alive.
It's not chance, Mr Holmes - it's chess.
It's a game of chess, with one move and one survivor.
And thisthis is the move.
Did I just give you the good bottle or the bad bottle? You can choose either one.
No, Detective Inspector Lestrade - I need to speak to him.
It's important.
It's an emergency.
Er, left here, please.
Left here You ready yet, Mr Holmes? - Ready to play? - Play what? It's a 50:50 chance.
You're not playing the numbers - you're playing me.
Did I just give you the good pill or the bad pill? Is it a bluff or a double bluff? - Or a triple bluff? - It's still just chance.
Four people, in a row? It's not chance.
- Luck.
- It's genius! I know how people think.
I know how people think I think.
I can see it all like a map inside my head.
Everyone's so stupid, even you.
Or maybe God just loves me.
Either way, you're wasted as a cabbie.
So you risked your life four times just to kill strangers - why? Time to play.
Oh, I am playing.
This is my turn.
There's shaving foam behind your left ear.
Nobody's pointed it out to you.
Traces of where it's happened before, so obviously you live on your own - there's no-one to tell you.
But there's a photograph of children.
The children's mother's been cut out.
If she'd died, she'd still be there.
The photograph's old, but the frame's new.
You think of your children, but you don't get to see them.
Estranged father.
She took the kids, but you still love them, and it still hurts.
Ah, but there's more.
Your clothes.
Recently laundered, but everything you're wearing is at leastthree years old? Keeping up appearances, but not planning ahead.
And here you are on a kamikaze murder spree.
What's that about? Ah three years ago.
Is that when they told you? Told me what? - That you're a dead man walking.
- So are you.
You don't have long, though.
Am I right? Aneurism.
Right in 'ere.
Any breath could be my last.
And because you're dying, you've just murdered four people.
I've outlived four people.
That's the most fun you can have with an aneurism.
No No, there's something else.
You didn't just kill four people because you're bitter.
Bitterness is a paralytic.
Love is a much more vicious motivator.
Somehow, this is about your children.
Oh - You are good, in't ya? - But how? When I die, they won't get much, my kids.
Not a lot of money in driving cabs.
- Or serial killing.
- You'd be surprised.
Surprise me.
- I have a sponsor.
- You have a what? For every life I take, money goes to my kids.
The more I kill the better off they'll be.
You see? It's nicer than you think.
Who'd sponsor a serial killer? Who'd be a fan of Sherlock Holmes? You're not the only one to enjoy a good murder.
There's others out there just like you, except you're just a man.
And they're so much more than that.
What do you mean more than a man? An organisationwhat? There's a name that no-one says.
And I'm not going to say it either.
Now, enough chatter.
Time to choose.
Sherlock! What if I don't choose either? I could just walk out of here.
You can take a 50:50 chance, or I can shoot you in the head.
Funnily enough, no-one's ever gone for that option.
I'll have the gun, please.
Are you sure? Definitely.
The gun.
You don't want to phone a friend The gun.
I know a real gun when I see one.
- None of the others did.
- Clearly.
Well, this has been very interesting.
I look forward to the court case.
Just before you go, did you figure it out? Which one's the good bottle? Course.
Child's play.
Well, which one, then? Which one would you have picked? Just so I know whether I could have beaten you.
Come on! Play the game.
Oh! Interesting.
So what do you think? Shall we? Reallywhat do you think? Can you beat me? Are you clever enough to bet your life? Sherlock! I bet you get bored, don't you? I know you do.
A man like you.
So clever.
But what's the point of being clever if you can't prove it? Still the addict.
But thisthis is what you're really addicted to.
You'll do anything anything at all, to stop being bored.
You're not bored now, are ya? Isn't it good? Was I right? I was, wasn't I? Did I get it right? OKtell me this.
Your sponsor.
Who was it? The one who told you about me, my fan.
I want a name.
No You're dying, but there's still time to hurt you.
Give mea name.
A name! Now! The name! Moriarty! Why have I got this blanket? They keep putting this blanket on me.
- Yeah, it's for shock.
- I'm not in shock.
Yeah, but some of the guys want to take photographs.
So, the shooter - no sign? Cleared off before we got here.
But a guy like that would have had enemies, I suppose.
One of them could have been following him, but we've got nothing to go on.
Oh, I wouldn't say that.
OK.
Give me.
The bullet they just dug out of the wall's from a handgun.
A kill shot over that distance, from that kind of a weapon, that's a crack shot.
But not just a marksman, a fighter.
His hands couldn't have shaken at all, so clearly he's acclimatised to violence.
He didn't fire until I was in immediate danger, though, so strong moral principle.
You're looking for a man probably with a history of military service and nerves of steel Actually, do you know what? Ignore me.
- Sorry? - Ignore all of that.
- It's just the, erthe shock talking.
- Where are you going? I just need totalk about thethe rent.
- I've still got questions.
- Oh, what now?! I'm in shock - look, I've got a blanket.
- Sherlock! - And I just caught you a serial killer more or less.
OK.
We'll pull you in tomorrow.
Off you go.
ErmSergeant Donovan'sjust been explainingeverything.
Two pills Dreadful business, isn't it? Dreadful.
Good shot.
Yes.
Yes, must have been.
Through that window.
Well, you'd know.
Need to get the powder burns out of your fingers.
I don't suppose you'd serve time for this, but let's avoid the court case.
- Are you all right? - Yes, of course I'm all right.
- Well, you have just killed a man.
- Yes, I That's true, isn't it? But he wasn't a very nice man.
- No.
No, he wasn't, really, was he? - Frankly, a bloody awful cabbie.
That's true, he was a bad cabbie.
You should have seen the route he took us to get here.
Stop! We can't giggle, it's a crime scene.
Stop it.
- You're the one who shot him.
- Keep your voice down! Sorry, it's just, ermnerves, I think.
Sorry.
You were going to take that damn pill, weren't you? Course I wasn't.
Biding my time.
Knew you'd turn up.
No, you didn't.
That's how you get your kicks, isn't it? You risk your life to prove you're clever.
- Why would I do that? - Because you're an idiot.
- Dinner? - Starving.
End of Baker Street, there's a good Chinese.
Stays open till two.
You can tell a good Chinese by the bottom third of the door handle.
Sherlockthat's him, that's the man I was talking to you about.
I know exactly who that is.
Soanother case cracked.
How very public-spirited.
Though that's never really your motivation, is it? What are you doing here? As ever, I'm concerned about you.
Yes, I've been hearing about your "concern".
Always so aggressive.
Did it never occur to you that you and I belong on the same side? Oddly enoughno.
We have more in common than you'd like to believe.
This petty feud between us is simply childish.
People will suffer.
And you know how it always upset Mummy.
I upset her? Me? It wasn't me that upset her, Mycroft.
No.
No, wait Mummy? Who's Mummy? Mother.
Our mother.
This is my brother, Mycroft.
Putting on weight again? - Losing it, in fact.
- He's your brother? Course he's my brother.
- So he's not - Not what? - I don't knowcriminal mastermind? - Close enough.
For goodness' sake, I occupy a minor position in the British Government.
He is the British Government, when he's not too busy being the British Secret Service or the CIA on a freelance basis.
Good evening, Mycroft.
Try not to start a war before I get home - you know what it does for the traffic.
So, when you say you're concerned about him, you actually are concerned? Yes, of course.
It actually is a childish feud? He's always been so resentful.
You can imagine the Christmas dinners.
Yeah No God, no.
I'd better, erm Hello again.
- Hello.
- We met earlier on this evening.
Oh! - OK.
Good night.
- Good night, Dr Watson.
- So, dim sum.
- Mmm! I can always predict the fortune cookies.
- No, you can't.
- Almost can.
You did get shot, though.
- Sorry? - In Afghanistan.
There was an actual wound.
- Oh.
Yeah, shoulder.
- Shoulder! I thought so.
- No, you didn't.
- The left one.
- Lucky guess.
- I never guess.
Yes, you do.
- What are you so happy about? - Moriarty.
- What's Moriarty? - I've absolutely no idea.
Sir, shall we go? Interesting, that soldier fellow.
He could be the making of my brother or make him worse than ever.
Either way, we'd better upgrade their surveillance status.
Grade 3 active.
Sorry, sir - whose status? 
Woman: The great artisans say the more the teapot is used the more beautiful it becomes.
The pot is seasoned by repeatedly pouring tea over the surface.
The deposit left on the clay creates this beautiful patina over time.
Some pots, the clay has been burnished by tea made over four hundred years ago.
PA System: This museum will be closing in ten minutes.
Four hundred years old, they're letting you use it to make yourself a brew.
Some things aren't supposed to sit behind glass, they're made to be touched.
To be handled.
[sighs] These pots need attention.
The clay is cracking.
Well, I can't see how a tiny splash of tea is going to help.
Sometimes you have to look hard at something to see its value.
See? This one shines a little brighter.
I don't suppose Um, I mean I don't suppose that you want to have a drink? Not tea, obviously.
Um, in a pub, with me, tonight.
Um? You wouldn't like me all that much.
Can I maybe decide that for myself? I can't.
I'm sorry.
Please stop asking.
[thud] [clunk] [lock clicks] Is that security? Hello? Sherlock 1x2 The Blind Banker [beeps] PA System: Can the till supervisor please go to? Computer-generated Message: Unexpected item in bagging area, please try again.
[grunting and groaning] Argh! [thud] Item not scanned.
Please try again.
Can you maybe keep your voice down? - Card not authorised.
- Yes, all right! I've got it.
Please use an alternative method of payment.
Card not authorised.
Please use an alternative method of payment.
Keep it.
Keep that.
[grunts] Look! [sighs] [motorcycle engine revs] - You took your time.
- Yeah, I didn't get the shopping.
What? Why not? Because I had a row in the shop with a chip and PIN machine.
You You had a row with a machine?! Sort of.
It sat there and I shouted abuse.
Have you got cash? Take my card.
You could always go yourself, you know, you've been sitting there all morning, you've not even moved since I left.
[grunts and groans] And what happened about that case you were offered - The Jaria diamond? - Not interested.
[metallic clank] I sent them a message.
[thud] [Watson sighs and tuts] Don't worry about me, I can manage.
- Is that my computer? - Of course.
- What? - Mine was in the bedroom.
What? And you couldn't be bothered to get up? It's password protected.
In a manner of speaking.
Took me less than a minute to guess yours, not exactly Fort Knox.
Right.
Thank you.
Oh - Need to get a job.
- Oh, dull.
Listen, um If you'd be able to lend me some - Sherlock, are you listening? - I need to go to the bank.
Yes, when you said we were going to the bank [door beeps] [elevator pings] Sherlock Holmes.
Sherlock Holmes.
- Sebastian.
- Hiya, buddy.
How long? Eight years since I last clapped eyes on you? This is my friend, John Watson.
- Friend? - Colleague.
Right.
Grab a pew.
Do you need anything, coffee, water? No? We're all sorted here, thanks.
So you're doing well.
You've been abroad a lot.
Well, so? Flying all the way around the world twice in a month.
[scoffs] Right.
You're doing that thing.
We were at uni together, and this guy here had a trick he used to do.
It's not a trick.
He could look at you and tell you your whole life story.
- Yes, I've seen him do it.
- Put the wind up everybody, we hated him.
We'd come down to breakfast in the formal hall and this freak would know you'd been shagging the previous night.
- I simply observed.
- Go on, enlighten me.
Two trips a month, flying all the way around the world, you're quite right.
How could you tell? Are you going to tell me there's a stain on my tie from some special kind of ketchup you can only buy in Manhattan? - No, I - Is it the mud on my shoes? I was just chatting with your secretary outside.
She told me.
[laughs] I'm glad you could make it over, we've had a break-in.
Sir William's office The bank's former chairman.
The room's been left here like a sort of memorial.
Someone broke in late last night.
- What did they steal? - Nothing.
Just left a little message.
[phone ringing] [electronic beep] Sixty seconds apart.
[electronic beep] So, someone came up here in the middle of the night, splashed paint around and left within a minute.
How many ways into that office? Well, that's where this gets really interesting.
Every door that opens in this bank, it gets logged right here.
Every walk-in cupboard, every toilet.
That door didn't open last night? There's a hole in our security.
Find it and we'll pay you.
Five figures.
This is an advance.
Tell me how he got in.
There's a bigger one on its way.
I don't need an incentive, Sebastian.
He's, er He's kidding you, obviously.
Shall I look after that for him? Thanks.
Two trips around the world this month.
You didn't ask his secretary, you said that just to irritate him.
- How did you know? - Did you see his watch? His watch? The time was right, but the date was wrong.
Said two days ago.
Crossed the date line twice and he didn't alter it.
- Within a month? How did you get that? - New Breitling.
Only came out this February.
Okay.
So do you think we should sniff around here for a bit longer? Got everything I need to know already, thanks.
That graffiti was a message.
Someone at the bank, working on the trading floors.
We find the intended recipient and They'll lead us to the person who sent it? Obvious.
Well, there's three hundred people up there, who was it meant for? - Pillars.
- What? Pillars and the screens.
Very few places you could see that graffiti from.
That narrows the field considerably.
And, of course, the message was left at 11.
34 last night.
That tells us a lot.
- Does it? - Traders come to work at all hours.
Some trade with Hong Kong in the middle of the night.
That message was intended for somebody who came in at midnight.
Not many Van Coons in the phone book.
Taxi! [buzzes] So what do we do now? Sit here and wait for him to come back? - Just moved in.
- What? - Floor above, new label.
- Could have just replaced it.
[buzzes] - No-one ever does that.
Woman: Hello? Hi, um, I live in the flat just below you.
I don't think we've met.
No, well, er, I've just moved in.
Actually, I've just locked my keys in my flat.
Do you want me to buzz you in? Yeah.
And can we use your balcony? What?! [door buzzes] Watson: Sherlock? Watson: Sherlock, are you okay? Yeah, any time you feel like letting me in Do you think he'd lost a lot of money? Suicide is pretty common among City boys.
- We don't know that it was suicide.
- Come on.
The door was locked from the inside, you had to climb down the balcony.
Been away three days judging by the laundry.
Look at the case, there was something tightly packed inside it.
- Thanks.
I'll take your word for it.
- Problem? Yeah, I'm not desperate to root around some bloke's dirty underwear.
Those symbols at the bank, the graffiti, why were they put there? - Some sort of code? - Obviously.
Why were they painted? Want to communicate, why not use e-mail? Well, maybe he wasn't answering.
Oh, good, you follow.
No.
What kind of a message would everyone try to avoid? What about this morning? - Those letters you were looking at? - Bills? Yes.
He was being threatened.
Not by the Gas Board.
Dimmock: see if we can get prints off this glass.
Sergeant, we haven't met.
Yeah, I know who you are and I would prefer it if you didn't tamper with any of the evidence.
- I phoned Lestrade.
Is he on his way? - He's busy.
I'm in charge.
And it's not Sergeant, it's Detective Inspector Dimmock.
We're obviously looking at a suicide.
It does seem the only explanation of all the facts.
Wrong, it's one possible explanation of some of the facts.
You've got a solution that you like, but you are choosing to ignore anything you see that doesn't comply with it.
- Like? - Wound's on the right side of his head.
- And? - Van Coon was left-handed.
Requires quite a bit of contortion.
- Left-handed? - I'm amazed you didn't notice.
All you have to do is look around this flat.
Coffee table on the left-hand side, coffee mug handle pointing to the left.
Power sockets, habitually used the ones on the left.
Pen and paper on the left of the phone.
Picked up with his right, took messages with his left.
- D'you want me to go on? - No, I think you've covered it.
I might as well, I'm almost at the bottom of the list.
There's a knife on the breadboard with butter on the right side of the blade because he used it with his left.
It's highly unlikely that a left-handed man would shoot himself in the right of his head.
Conclusion, someone broke in here and murdered him.
Only explanation of all of the facts.
- But the gun? - He was waiting for the killer.
- He'd been threatened.
- What? Today at the bank, sort of a warning.
He fired a shot when his attacker came in.
- And the bullet? - Went through the open window.
Oh, come on! What are the chances of that?! Wait until you get the ballistics report.
The bullet in his brain wasn't fired from his gun, I guarantee it.
If his door was locked from the inside, how did the killer get in? Good, you're finally asking the right questions.
He's left trying to sort of cut his hair with a fork, which of course can never be done.
It was a threat, that's what the graffiti meant.
I'm kind of in a meeting.
Can you make an appointment with my secretary? I don't think this can wait.
Sorry, Sebastian.
One of your traders, someone who worked in your office, was killed.
- What? - Van Coon.
The police are at his flat.
- Killed?! - Sorry to interfere with everyone's digestion.
Still want to make an appointment? Would maybe nine o'clock at Scotland Yard suit? Harrow, Oxford Very bright guy.
Worked in Asia for a while, so You gave him the Hong Kong accounts? Lost five million in a single morning, made it all back a week later.
Nerves of steel, Eddie had.
- Who'd want to kill him? - We all make enemies.
You don't all end up with a bullet through your temple.
[cell phone chimes] Not usually.
Excuse me.
It's my chairman.
Police have been on to him.
Apparently they're telling him - it was a suicide.
- Well, they've got it wrong, Sebastian.
He was murdered.
Well, I'm afraid they don't see it like that.
- So? - And neither does my boss.
I hired you to do a job.
Don't get sidetracked.
I thought bankers were all supposed to be heartless bastards.
[horn blares] I need you to get over to Crispians.
Two Ming vases up for auction Chenghua.
- Will you appraise them? - Soo Lin should go, she's the expert.
Soo Lin has resigned her job.
I need you.
- Just locum work.
- No, that's fine.
You're, um Well, you're a bit over-qualified.
Er, I could always do with the money.
Well, we've got two away on holiday this week and one's just left to have a baby.
It might be a bit mundane for you.
Er, no, mundane is good, sometimes.
Mundane works.
- It says here you were a soldier.
- And a doctor.
Anything else you can do? I learned the clarinet at school.
Oh [laughs] Well, I'll look forward to it.
I said, could you pass me a pen? - What? When? - About an hour ago.
Didn't notice I'd gone out then? I went to see about a job at that surgery.
- How was it? - Great.
She's great.
Who? The job.
She? It.
Yeah, have a look.
"The intruder who can walk through walls.
" It happened last night.
Journalist shot dead in his flat.
Doors locked, windows bolted from the inside.
Exactly the same as Van Coon.
- God! You think? - He's killed another one.
Brian Lukis, freelance journalist, murdered in his flat.
Doors locked from the inside.
You've got to admit, it's similar.
Both men killed by someone who can walk through solid walls.
Inspector, do you seriously believe that Eddie Van Coon was just another city suicide? [sighs] You have seen the ballistics report, I suppose? And the shot that killed him.
Was it fired from his own gun? - No.
- No.
So this investigation might move a bit quicker if you were to take my word as gospel.
I've just handed you a murder inquiry.
Five minutes in his flat.
Four floors up.
That's why they think they're safe.
Put a chain across the door, bolt it shut, think they're impregnable.
They don't reckon for one second that there's another way in.
- I don't understand.
- Dealing with a killer who can climb.
- What are you doing? - Clings to the walls like an insect.
[clunk] That's how he got in.
What?! He climbed up the side of the walls, ran along the roof, dropped in through this skylight.
You're not serious?! Like Spider-Man? He scaled six floors of a Docklands apartment building, - jumped the balcony and killed Van Coon.
- Oh, hold on! That's how he got into the bank.
Ran along the window ledge onto the terrace.
I have to find out what connects these two men.
Date stamped on the book is the same day that he died.
Sherlock.
So, the killer goes to the bank, leaves a threatening cipher at the bank.
Van Coon panics, returns to his apartment, locks himself in.
Hours later, he dies.
The killer finds Lukis at the library, he writes the cipher on the shelf where he knows it'll be seen.
Lukis goes home.
Late that night, he dies too.
Why did they die, Sherlock? Only the cipher can tell us.
The world's run on codes and ciphers, John.
From the million-pound security system at the bank to the PIN machine you took exception to.
Cryptography inhabits our every waking moment.
Yes, okay, but But it's all computer generated.
Electronic codes, electronic ciphering methods.
This is different.
It's an ancient device.
Modern code-breaking methods won't unravel it.
- Where are we headed? - I need to ask some advice.
What?! Sorry? You heard me perfectly.
I'm not saying it again.
- You need advice? - On painting.
Yes, I need to talk to an expert.
Part of a new exhibition.
- Interesting.
- I call it Urban Bloodlust Frenzy.
[chuckles] Catchy.
I've got two minutes before a Community Support Officer comes around that corner.
Can we do this while I'm working? - Know the author? - I recognise the paint.
It's like Michigan hard-core propellant.
I'd say zinc.
And what about the symbols? Do you recognise them? I'm not even sure it's a proper language.
Two men have been murdered, Raz.
Deciphering this is the key to finding out who killed them.
And this is all you've got to go on? - It's hardly much, is it? - Are you going to help us or not? I'll ask around.
- Somebody must know something about it.
Officers: Oi! [metallic clattering] What the hell do you think you're doing? This gallery is a listed public building.
No, no.
Wait, wait.
It's not me who painted that.
I was just holding this for Bit of an enthusiast, are we? She was right in the middle of an important piece of restoration.
Why would she suddenly resign? Family problems.
She said so in her letter.
But she doesn't have a family.
She came to this country on her own.
- Andy! - Look, those teapots, those ceramics.
They've become her obsession.
She's been working on restoring them for weeks.
I can't believe that she would just abandon them.
Perhaps she was getting a bit of unwanted attention? [door slams] You've been a while.
Yeah, well, you know how it is.
Custody sergeants don't really like to be hurried, do they? Just formalities.
Fingerprints, charge sheet, and I've got to be in magistrates' court on Tuesday.
- What? - Me, Sherlock! In court, on Tuesday! - They're giving me an ASBO! - Good, fine.
You want to tell your little pal he's welcome to go and own up any time.
This symbol, I still can't place it.
No, I need you to go to the police station and ask about the journalist.
The personal effects will have been impounded.
Get hold of his diary, or something that will tell us his movements.
Gonna see Van Coon's PA.
If you retrace their steps, somewhere they'll coincide.
[shutter clicks] Scotland Yard.
Flew back from Dalian Friday.
Looks like he had back-to-back meetings with the sales team.
Can you print me up a copy? - Sure.
- What about the day he died? - Can you tell me where he was? - Sorry, I've got a gap.
I have all his receipts.
- Your friend - Listen, whatever you say, I'm behind you one hundred per cent.
He's an arrogant sod.
Well, that was mild.
People say a lot worse than that.
This is what you wanted, isn't it? The journalist's diary? What kind of a boss was he, Amanda? Appreciative? Um, no.
That's not a word I'd use.
The only things Eddie appreciated had a big price tag.
Like that hand cream.
He bought that for you, didn't he? Look at this one.
Got a taxi from him on the day he died, 18.
50.
That would get him to the office.
Not rush hour.
Check the time.
Mid-morning.
18 would get him - as far as - The West End.
I remember him saying.
Underground, printed at one in Piccadilly.
So he got a Tube back to the office.
Why would he get a taxi into town, and then the Tube back? Because he was delivering something heavy.
You wouldn't lug a package up the escalator.
Delivering? To somewhere near Piccadilly Station.
Dropped the package, delivered it, and then Stopped on his way.
He got peckish.
So you bought your lunch from here en route to the station but where were you headed from? Where did the taxi drop you? - Oof! - Right.
Eddie Van Coon brought a package here the day he died.
Whatever was hidden inside that case I've managed to piece together a picture using scraps of information Credit card bills, receipts.
He flew back from China, - then he came here.
- Sherlock.
Somewhere in this street, somewhere near.
I don't know where, but - That shop, over there.
- How could you tell? Lukis' diary.
He was here too.
- He wrote down the address.
- Oh.
[shop bell rings] Hello.
You want lucky cat? No, thanks, no.
10! 10! I think your wife, she will like.
Um, thank you.
Sherlock - The label there.
- Yes, I see it.
It's exactly the same as the cipher.
[Watson clears throat] It's an ancient number system.
Hang Zhou.
These days only street traders use it.
Those were numbers written on the wall at the bank and at the library.
Numbers written in an ancient Chinese dialect.
It's a fifteen.
What we thought was the artist's tag, it's a number fifteen.
And the blindfold, the horizontal line.
That was a number as well.
- The Chinese number one, John.
- We found it.
Two men travel back from China, both head straight for The Lucky Cat emporium.
What did they see? It's not what they saw.
It's what they both brought back in those suitcases.
And you don't mean duty free.
Thank you.
Think about what Sebastian told us.
About Van Coon, about how he stayed afloat in the market.
- Lost five million.
- Made it back in a week.
That's how he made such easy money.
He was a smuggler.
Mm.
Cover would have been perfect.
Businessman, making frequent trips to Asia.
Lukis was the same, a journalist writing about China.
Both of them smuggled stuff about.
The Lucky Cat was their drop-off.
But why did they die? It doesn't make sense.
If they both turn up at the shop and deliver the goods, why would someone threaten them and kill them after the event, after they'd finished the job? What if one of them was light-fingered? - How do you mean? - Stole something.
Something from the hoard.
The killer doesn't know which of them took it so threatens them both.
Right.
Remind me.
When was the last time that it rained? It's been here since Monday.
[doorbell rings] No-one's been in that flat for at least three days.
Could have gone on holiday.
Do you leave your windows open when you go on holiday? [metallic creak] Sherlock! Whoa! [water drips] Someone else has been here.
Somebody else broke into the flat and knocked over the vase, just like I did.
[sniffs] [doorbell rings] Watson: Do you think maybe you could let me in this time? Can you not keep doing this, please? I'm not the first.
- What? - Somebody's been in here before me.
What are you saying? Size eight feet.
Small, but athletic.
I'm wasting my breath.
[doorbell rings] Small, strong hands.
Our acrobat.
Why didn't he close the window when he lef? Oh, stupid, stupid! Obvious.
He's still here.
[chokes] Any time you want to include me John John! Oh, I'm Sherlock Holmes and I always work alone because no-one else can compete with my massive intellect! [doorbell rings] [sputters and coughs] [groans] The milk's gone off and the washing's started to smell.
- Somebody left here in a hurry three days ago.
- Somebody? Soo Lin Yao.
We have to find her.
How, exactly? We could start with this.
You've gone all croaky.
Are you getting a cold? [coughs] I'm fine.
When was the last time that you saw her? Andy: Three days ago.
Here at the museum.
This morning they told me she'd resigned.
Just like that.
Left her work unfinished.
What was the last thing that she did on her final afternoon? She does this demonstration for the tourists, a tea ceremony.
So she would have packed up her things and just put them in here.
We have to get to Soo Lin Yao.
- If she's still alive.
Raz: Sherlock! Oh, look who it is.
Found something you'll like.
Tuesday morning, all you've got to do is turn up and say the bag was yours.
Forget about your court date.
Girl: Dude, that was rad! You want to hide a tree, then a forest is the best place to do it, wouldn't you say? People would just walk straight past, not knowing, unable to decipher the message.
There.
I spotted it earlier.
They've been here.
And that's the exact same paint? Yeah.
John, if we're going to decipher this code, we need to look for more evidence.
Watson: Answer your phone.
I've been calling you.
[panting] I found it.
It's been painted over.
I don't understand.
It was here.
Ten minutes ago.
I saw it.
A whole load of graffiti.
Somebody doesn't want me to see it.
- Sherlock, what are you doing? - Ssh! John, concentrate.
I need you to concentrate.
Close your eyes.
What? Why? Why? What are you doing? I need you to maximise your visual memory.
Try to picture what you saw.
- Can you picture it? - Yeah.
- Can you remember it? - Yes, definitely.
Can you remember the pattern? - Yes.
- How much can you remember it? Look, don't worry.
Because the average human memory on visual matters is only 62% accurate.
- Well, don't worry, I remember all of it.
- Really? At least I would, if I could get to my pockets.
I took a photograph.
[cell phone beeps] Always in pairs, John, look.
Numbers come with partners.
God, I need to sleep.
- Why did he paint it so near the tracks? - No idea.
Thousands of people pass by there every day.
Just twenty minutes Of course.
Of course, he wants information.
He's trying to communicate with his people in the underworld.
Whatever was stolen, he wants it back.
It's somewhere here, in a code.
We can't crack this without Soo Lin Yao.
Oh, good.
Two men who travelled back from China were murdered.
And their killer left them messages in Hang Zhou numerals.
Soo Lin Yao is in danger.
That cipher, it was just the same pattern as the others.
He means to kill her as well.
Look, I've tried everywhere Friends, colleagues.
I don't know where she's gone.
I mean, she could be a thousand miles away.
- What are you looking at? - Tell me more about those teapots.
The pots were her obsession.
They need urgent work.
If they dry out, then the clay can start to crumble.
Apparently, you have to just keep making tea in them.
Yesterday, only one of those pots was shining.
Now, there are two.
[grating] Fancy a biscuit with that? [gasps] Centuries old.
Don't want to break that.
Hello.
You saw the cipher.
Then you know he is coming for me.
You've been clever to avoid him so far.
I had to finish.
To finish this work.
It's only a matter of time.
I know he will find me.
Who is he? Have you met him before? When I was a girl, we met in China.
I recognised his - signature.
- The cipher? Only he would do this.
Zhi Zhu.
- Zhi Zhu? - The spider.
You know this mark? Yes.
It's the mark of a Tong.
Huh? Ancient crime syndicate, based in China.
Every foot soldier bears the mark.
Everyone who hauls for them.
Hauls? You mean you were a smuggler? I was fifteen.
My parents were dead.
I had no livelihood.
No way of surviving, day-to-day, except to work for the bosses.
Who are they? They are called the Black Lotus.
By the time I was sixteen, I was taking thousands of pounds worth of drugs across the border into Hong Kong.
I managed to leave that life behind me.
I came to England.
They gave me a job, here.
Everything was good.
New life.
And he came looking for you.
Yes.
I hoped, after five years maybe they would have forgotten me.
But they never really let you leave.
A small community like ours They are never very far away.
He came to my flat.
He asked me to help him to track down something that was stolen.
And you've no idea what it was? I refused to help.
So, you knew him well when you were living back in China? Oh, yes.
He's my brother.
Two orphans.
We had no choice.
We could work for the Black Lotus, or starve on the streets, like beggars.
My brother has become their puppet.
In the power of the one they call Shan.
The Black Lotus general.
I turned my brother away.
He said I had betrayed him.
Next day, I came to work and the cipher was waiting.
Can you decipher these? These are numbers.
Yes, I know.
Here, the line across the man's eyes, it's the Chinese number one.
And this one is fifteen.
But what's the code? All the smugglers know it.
It's based upon a book [door thuds] He's here.
Zhi Zhu has found me.
No, no, Sherlock.
Sherlock, wait! Come here.
Get in.
Get in! [gunshot] [gunshot] [more gunshots] I have to go and help him.
Bolt the door after me.
[gunshots] [more gunshots] Careful! [gunshot] Some of those skulls are over 200,000 years old.
Have a bit of respect.
Thank you.
Liang.
[speaking Chinese] [speaking Chinese] [gunshot] Oh, my God.
How many murders is it going to take before you start believing that this maniac's out there? A young girl was gunned down tonight.
That's three victims in three days.
You're supposed to be finding him.
Brian Lukis and Eddie Van Coon were working for a gang of international smugglers.
A gang called the Black Lotus, operating here in London right under your nose.
Can you prove that? - What are you thinking? Pork or pasta? - Oh, it's you.
I suppose it's never going to trouble Egon Ronay, is it? I'd stick with the pasta.
Don't want to be doing roast pork, not if you're slicing up cadavers.
What are you having? I don't eat when I'm working.
Digesting slows me down.
So you're working here tonight? - Need to examine some bodies.
- Some? Eddie Van Coon and Brian Lukis.
They're on my list.
Could you wheel them out again for me? Well their paperwork's already gone through.
- You changed your hair.
- What? The style.
It's usually parted in the middle.
Yes, well It's good.
It suits you better this way.
We're just interested in the feet.
- The feet? - Yes.
Do you mind if we have a look at them? Now, Van Coon.
- Oh! - So So either these two men just happened to visit the same Chinese tattoo parlour, - or I'm telling the truth.
- What do you want? I want every book from Lukis' apartment and Van Coon's.
Their books? Not just a criminal organisation.
It's a cult.
Her brother was corrupted by one of its leaders.
Soo Lin said the name.
Yes, Shan.
General Shan.
We're still no closer to finding him.
Wrong! We've got almost all we need to know.
She gave us most of the missing pieces.
Why did he need to visit his sister? - Why did he need her expertise? - She worked at the museum.
Exactly.
An expert in antiquities.
- Of course, I see.
- Valuable antiquities, John.
Ancient Chinese relics purchased on the black market.
China's home to a thousand treasures hidden after Mao's revolution.
The Black Lotus is selling them.
Check for the dates Here, John, "Arrived from China four days ago".
Anonymous.
The vendor doesn't give his name.
"Two undiscovered treasures from the East.
" One in Lukis' suitcase and one in Van Coon's.
"Antiquities "sold at auction.
" Look, here's another one.
Arrived from China a month ago, Chinese ceramic statue sold for 400,000.
Look, a month before that, Chinese painting, 500,000.
All of them from an anonymous source.
They're stealing them back in China and one by one feeding them into Britain.
Every single auction coincides with Lukis or Van Coon travelling to China.
So what if one of them got greedy when they were in China? What if one of them stole something? That's why Zhi Zhu's come.
[knock at door] Sorry, are we collecting for charity, Sherlock? What? A young man's outside with crates of books.
So the numbers are references.
To books.
To specific pages and specific words on those pages.
Right, so Fifteen and one, that means? Turn to page fifteen and it's the first word you read.
- Okay, so what's the message? - Depends on the book.
That's the cunning of the book code.
It has to be one that they both own.
Okay, fine.
This shouldn't take too long, should it? We found these at the museum.
Is this your writing? Er, we hoped Soo Lin could decipher it for us.
Ta.
Anything else I can do? To assist you, I mean.
Some silence right now would be marvellous.
Cigarette.
Imagine.
[clock ticks] [watch beeps] Oh I'm sorry to keep you waiting, but we haven't got anything now until next Thursday.
Woman: This is taking ages.
Sorry.
Woman: What's the point of booking an appointment if they can't stick to it? Um, what's going on? That new doctor you hired, he hasn't buzzed the intercom for ages.
Let me go and have a word.
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.
[knocking on door] John? John? [gentle snoring] Looks like I'm done.
I thought I had some more to see.
- Oh, I did one or two of yours.
- One or two? Well, maybe five or six.
I'm sorry, that's not very professional.
No, not really.
I had a bit of a late one.
Oh, right.
Anyway, see you.
So what were you doing to keep you up so late? I was attending a sort of book event.
Oh.
Oh, she likes books, does she, your girlfriend? No, it wasn't a date.
- Good.
I mean, I'm - And I don't have one tonight.
A book that everybody would own.
Fifteen, entry one.
I need to get some air.
We're going out tonight.
- Actually, I've got a date.
- What? Where two people who like each other go out and have fun? That's what I was suggesting.
No, it wasn't.
At least, I hope not.
Where are you taking her? Er, cinema.
Dull, boring, predictable Why don't you try this? In London for one night only.
[laughs nervously] Thanks, but I don't come to you for dating advice.
Sarah: It's years since anyone took me to the circus.
Right, yes.
A friend recommended it to me and I phoned up.
Oh! What are they, a touring company or something? I don't know much about it.
I think they're probably from China.
I think so, yes.
There's a coincidence That's wonderful, thank you very much.
Hi, I have two tickets reserved for tonight.
- And what's the name? - Holmes.
Actually, I have three in that name.
No, I don't think so, we only booked two.
Then I phoned back and got one for myself as well.
I'm Sherlock.
- Hi.
- Hello.
You couldn't let me have just one night off.
Yellow Dragon Circus, in London for one day.
It fits.
The Tong sent an assassin to England Dressed as a tightrope walker.
Come on, Sherlock, behave! We're looking for a killer who can climb, who can shin up a rope.
Where else would you find that level of dexterity? Exit visas are scarce in China.
They need a good reason to get out of that country.
All I need to do is have a quick look around Fine.
You do that, I'll take Sarah for a pint.
I need your help.
I do have a couple of other things on my mind this evening.
Like what? - You are kidding? - What's so important? Sherlock, I'm in the middle of a date.
You're going to chase some killer while I'm trying to What? While I'm trying to get off with Sarah.
Hey Ready? Yeah.
You said circus.
This is not a circus.
Look at the size of this crowd.
Sherlock, this is art.
This is not their day job.
Sorry, I forgot, they're not a circus, they're a gang of international smugglers.
[whoosh] [audience gasps] [applause] Classic Chinese escapology act.
- Hm? - The crossbow's on a delicate string.
The warrior has to escape his bonds before it fires.
[shouting] [gong] Oh! [laughing] She splits the sandbag, the sand pours out.
Gradually, the weight lowers into the bowl.
[shouting and straining] [applause] - Thank God.
- My God! [applause] Ladies and gentlemen.
From the distant moonlit shores of the Yangtze River, we present, for your pleasure, the deadly Chinese bird spider.
[applause] Did you see that? Well, well.
[door opens] [coat hangers rattle] [door opens and closes] Found you.
Come on.
Come on.
Let's go! I sent a couple of cars.
The old hall is totally deserted.
Look, I saw the mark at the circus.
The tattoo that we saw on the two bodies, the mark of the Tong.
Lukis and Van Coon were part of a smuggling operation.
One of them stole something in China.
Something valuable.
The circus performers were gang members - sent here to get it back.
- Get what back? We don't know.
You don't know? Mr.
Holmes, I've done everything you asked.
Lestrade, he seems to think your advice is worth something.
I gave the order for a raid.
Please tell me I'll have something to show for it.
Other than a massive bill for overtime.
They'll be back in China by tomorrow.
No, they won't leave without what they came for.
We need to find a hideout.
A rendezvous.
Somewhere in this message it must tell us.
Well, I think perhaps I should leave you to it.
- No, you don't have to go.
Stay.
- Yes, it'd be better if you left now.
He's kidding.
Please stay if you'd like.
Is it just me or is anyone else starving? Oh, God.
So this is what you do.
You and John, you solve puzzles for a living.
Consulting detective.
Oh.
Oh! What are these squiggles? They're numbers.
An ancient Chinese dialect.
Oh, right.
Well, of course I should have known that.
I've done punch and a bowl of nibbles.
Mrs.
Hudson, you are a saint.
If it was Monday, I'd have been to the supermarket.
Thank you.
- So these numbers, it's a cipher? - Exactly.
And each pair of numbers is a word? How did you know that? Well, two words have already been translated.
Here.
- John.
- Mmm? John, look at this.
Soo Lin at the museum, she started to translate the code for us.
We didn't see it.
Nine mill.
Does that mean millions? Nine million quid.
For what? We need to know the end of this sentence.
Where are you going? To the museum, to the restoration room.
- We must have been staring right at it.
- At what? The book, John.
The book.
The key to cracking the cipher.
Soo Lin used it to do this.
Whilst we were running around the gallery, she started to translate the code.
It must be on her desk.
Taxi! Entschuldigen Sie, bitte.
Ja, danke.
A book that everybody would own.
Please, wait! Bitte! Was wollt er? Hey, du, was machst du? - Minute! - Gib mir doch mein Buch zuruck! Yeah.
No, absolutely.
I mean, a quiet night in is just what the doctor ordered.
I mean, I love to go out of an evening and wrestle a few Chinese gangsters generally, but a girl can get too much.
Er, shall we get a takeaway? Yeah.
Page fifteen, entry one Page fifteen, entry one.
Dead man.
You were threatening to kill them.
That's the first cipher.
Nine Zero Fifteen er, fifteen and thirty-six.
Thirty-six, thirty-nine, thirty-nine Thirty-nine Nine "Nine", "mill", "for" [knock at door] Blimey, that was quick.
I'll just pop down.
Do you want me to lay the table? - Um eat off trays? - Yeah.
Seventy Thirty-five Jade Jade.
Sorry to keep you.
How much do you want? - Do you have it? - What? - Do you have the treasure? - I don't understand.
[mutters] "Nine mill for Jade pin.
"Dragon den, black "tramway.
" [door shuts] Holmes: John! John, I've got it.
The cipher, the book.
It's the London A-Z that they're us Woman: A book is like a magic garden, carried in your pocket.
- Chinese proverb, Mr.
Holmes.
- I'm I'm not Sherlock Holmes.
Forgive me if I do not take your word for it.
Ow! Debit card, name of S.
Holmes.
Take my card.
Yes, that's not actually mine.
He lent that to me.
And a cheque for 5,000 made out in the name of Mr.
Sherlock Holmes.
Yeah, he gave me that to look after.
Tickets from the theatre collected by you, name of Holmes.
Yes, okay.
- What's the name? - Er, Holmes.
I realise what this looks like.
But I'm not him.
- We heard it from your own mouth.
- What? "I am Sherlock Holmes and I always work alone.
" Because no-one else can compete with my massive intellect.
Did I really say that? I suppose there's no use me trying to persuade you I was doing an impression.
I am Shan.
You're You're Shan? Three times we tried to kill you and your companion, Mr.
Holmes.
What does it tell you when an assassin cannot shoot straight? [gun cocks] [barrel clicks] It tells you that they're not really trying.
Tramway.
There.
Not blank bullets now.
If we wanted to kill you, Mr.
Holmes, we would have done it by now.
We just wanted to make you inquisitive.
- Do you have it? - Do I have what? - The treasure.
- I don't know what you're talking about.
I would prefer to make certain.
Everything in the West has its price.
And the price for her life: Information.
[Sarah groans] I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
- Where's the hairpin? - What? The Empress Pin valued at 9 million sterling? We already had a buyer in the West and then one of our people was greedy, he took it, brought it back to London, and you, Mr.
Holmes, have been searching.
Please, please.
Listen to me.
I'm not I'm not Sherlock Holmes.
You have to believe me.
I haven't found whatever it is you're looking for.
- I need a volunteer from the audience.
- No, please, please! Ah, thank you, lady.
Yes, you'll do very nicely.
[muffled groans] Ladies and gentlemen, from the distant, moonlit shores of NW1, we present for your pleasure, Sherlock Holmes' pretty companion in a death-defying act.
Please! You've seen the act before.
How dull for you.
You know how it ends.
I'm not Sherlock Holmes! I don't believe you.
You should, you know.
Sherlock Holmes is nothing at all like him.
How would you describe me, John? - Resourceful? Dynamic? Enigmatic? - Late? That's a semi-automatic.
If you fire it, the bullet will travel at over 1,000 metres per second.
Well? Well [thump] The radius curvature of these walls is nearly four metres.
If you miss, the bullet will ricochet.
Could hit anyone.
Might even bounce off the tunnel and hit you.
[whoosh] [thump] [groans] [footsteps recede] It's all right.
[grunts] You're going to be all right.
It's over now.
Don't worry.
Next date won't be like this.
We'll just slip off.
No need to mention us in your report.
- Mr.
Holmes - I have high hopes for you, Inspector.
A glittering career.
I go where you point me.
Exactly.
[liquid gurgling] Watson: Ta.
- So, nine million.
- Million.
Million, yes.
Nine million for Jade pin Dragon Den Black Tramway.
An instruction to all their London operatives.
A message.
What they were trying to reclaim.
- What, a jade pin? - Worth 9 million.
Bring it to the Tramway, their London hideout.
Hang on.
A hairpin worth 9 million? - Apparently.
- Why so much? Depends who owned it.
Two operatives based in London.
They travel over to Dalian to smuggle those vases.
One of them helps himself to something, a little hairpin.
- Worth 9 million.
- Eddie Van Coon was the thief, he stole the treasure when he was in China.
How do you know it was Van Coon, not Lukis? - Even the killer didn't know that.
- Because of the soap.
[phone rings] - Amanda? Holmes: He brought you a present.
Oh, hello.
A little gift when he came back from China.
- How do you know that? - You weren't just his PA, were you? Someone's been gossiping.
- No.
- Then I don't understand why Scented hand soap in his apartment.
300ml of it.
Bottle almost finished.
- Sorry? - I don't think Eddie Van Coon was the type of chap to buy himself hand soap, not unless he had a lady coming over.
And it's the same brand as that hand cream there on your desk.
Look, it wasn't serious between us.
It was over in a flash, it couldn't last.
He was my boss.
What happened? Why did you end it? I thought he didn't appreciate me.
Took me for granted.
Stood me up once too often.
We'd plan to go away for the weekend, and then he'd just leave.
Fly off to China at a moment's notice.
And he brought you a present from abroad to say sorry.
Can I just have a look at it? He really climbed up onto the balcony? Nail a plank across the window and all your problems are over.
Thanks.
He said he bought it in a street market.
Oh, I don't think that's true.
I think he pinched it.
Yeah, that's Eddie.
Didn't know its value, just thought it would suit you.
Oh? What's it worth? 9 million.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God! Nine million?! Over 1,000 years old and it's sitting on her bedside table every night.
He didn't know its value.
Didn't know why they were chasing him.
Should've just got her a lucky cat.
- You mind, don't you? - What? That she escaped.
General Shan.
It's not enough that we got her two henchmen.
Must be a vast network, John.
Thousands of operatives.
You and I, we barely scratched the surface.
You cracked the code though, Sherlock.
And maybe Dimmock can track down all of them now he knows it.
No.
No, I crack this code, all the smugglers have to do is pick up another book.
Without you without your assistance, we would not have found passage into London.
You have my thanks.
We did not anticipate We did not know this man would come.
This Sherlock Holmes.
And now your safety is compromised.
I will not reveal your identity.
[gunshot] 
Just tell me what happened from the beginning.
We had been to a bar, nice place, and, er, I got chatting with one of the waitresses, and Karen weren't happy with that, so when we get back to the hotel, we end up having a bit of a ding-dong, don't we? She's always getting at me, saying I weren't a real man.
Wasn't a real man.
- What? - It's not "weren't", it's "wasn't".
Oh.
Go on.
Wellthen I don't know how it happened, but suddenly there's a knife in my hands and you know me old man was a butcher, so I know how to handle knives.
- He learned us how to cut up a beast.
- Taught.
- What? - Taught you how to cut up a beast.
Yeah, well, then I done it.
- Did it.
- Did it! Stabbed her! Over and over and over, and I looked down, and she weren't wasn't moving no more.
Any more.
God help me, I dunno how it happened, but it was an accident, I swear.
Eh, you've gotta help me, Mr Holmes! Everyone says you're the best.
Without you I'll get hung for this.
No, not at all, Mr Bewick.
Hanged, yes.
What the hell are you doing?! - Bored.
- What?! - Bored! - No Bored! Don't know what's got into the criminal classes.
- Good job I'm not one of them.
- So you take it out on the wall? The wall had it coming.
What about that Russian case? Belarus? Open and shut domestic murder.
Not worth my time.
Oh, shame Anything in? I'm starving.
Oh, f There's a head.
A bloody head! Well, where else was I supposed to put it? You don't mind, do you? - Well - Got it from Bart's morgue.
I'm measuring the coagulation of saliva after death.
I see you've written up the taxi driver case.
Eryes.
A Study In Pink.
Nice.
Well, you know.
Pink lady, pink case, pink phone.
There was a lot of pink.
Did you like it? - Umno.
- Why not? I thought you'd be flattered.
Flattered?! "Sherlock sees through everything and everyone in seconds.
"What's incredible, though, is how spectacularly ignorant he is - "about some things.
" - Hang on a minute, I didn't mean that Oh, you meant "spectacularly ignorant" in a nice way Look, it doesn't matter to me - who's Prime Minister or - Yeah, I know.
who's sleeping with who - Whether the earth goes round the sun.
- Not that again! It's not important! Not impor?! It's primary school stuff.
How can you not know that? Well, if I ever did, I've deleted it.
Deleted it? Listen.
This is my hard drive, and it only makes sense to put things in there that are useful.
Really useful.
Ordinary people fill their heads with all kinds of rubbish.
That makes it hard to get at the stuff that matters.
Do you see? But it's the solar system! Oh, hell! What does that matter?! So we go round the sun.
If we went round the moon, or round and round the garden like a teddy bear, it wouldn't make any difference! All that matters to me is the work! Without that, my brain rots! Put that in your blog! Or, better still, stop inflicting your opinions on the world! - Where are you going? - Out! I need some air.
Oh, sorry, love! Woo-hoo! Have you two had a little domestic? Ooh, it's a bit nippy out there.
He should have wrapped himself up a bit more.
Look at that, Mrs Hudson.
Quiet.
Calm.
Peaceful.
Isn't it hateful? Oh, I'm sure something will turn up, Sherlock.
A nice murder.
That'll cheer you up.
Mmm.
Can't come too soon.
Hey, what have you done to my bloody wall?! I'm putting this on your rent, young man! - Morning.
- Ohm-morning.
See, told you you should have gone with the Lilo.
No, no, no, it's fine, I slept fine.
It's very kind of you.
Well, maybe next time I'll let you kip at the end of my bed, you know.
which was discovered quietly mouldering What about the time after that? 18 months ago.
Experts are hailing it as the artistic find of the century and no-one - So, do you want some breakfast? - Love some.
Yeah, well, you'd better make it yourself because I'm going to have a shower.
It fetched over 20 million.
This one is anticipated to do even better.
Back now to our main story.
There has been a massive explosion in central London.
As yet, there are no reports of any casualties and the police are unable to say if there's any suspicion of terrorist involvement.
Sarah! Police have issued an emergency number - Sarah! - for friends and relatives.
Sorry! I've got to run! Excuse me, can I get through? Excuse me.
Can I get through? I live over there.
Sherlock! Sherlock! John.
I saw it on the telly.
Are you OK? Me? What? Oh, yeah, fine.
Gas leak, apparently.
- I can't.
- Can't? Stuff I've got on is just too big.
I can't spare the time.
Never mind your usual trivia.
This is of national importance.
How's the diet? Fine.
Perhaps you can get through to him, John? - What? - I'm afraid my brother can be very intransigent.
If you're so keen, why don't you investigate it? No, no, no, no, no.
I can't possibly be away from the office for any length of time.
Not with the Korean elections so Well, you don't need to know about that, do you? Besides, a case like this, it requireslegwork.
- How's Sarah, John? - How was the Lilo? Sofa, Sherlock.
It was the sofa.
- Oh, yes, of course.
- How? Oh, never mind.
Sherlock's business seems to be booming since you and he becamepals.
What's he like to live with? - Hellish, I imagine.
- I'm never bored.
Good.
That's good, isn't it? Andrew West, known as Westie to his friends.
Civil servant.
Found dead on the tracks at Battersea station this morning with his head smashed in.
Jumped in front of a train? Seems the logical assumption.
- But? - But? Well, you wouldn't be here if it was just an accident.
Huh! The MoD is working on a new missile defence system, the Bruce-Partington Program, it's called.
The plans for it were on a memory stick.
That wasn't very clever.
- It's not the only copy.
- Oh.
But it is secret.
And missing.
Top secret? Very.
We think West must have taken the memory stick.
We can't possibly risk it falling into the wrong hands.
You've got to find those plans, Sherlock.
- Don't make me order you.
- I'd like to see you try.
Think it over.
- Goodbye, John.
- Mm.
See you very soon.
Why did you lie? You've got nothing on.
Not a single case.
That's why the wall took a pounding.
Why did you tell your brother you were busy? Why shouldn't I? Oh.
Nice.
Sibling rivalry.
Now we're getting somewhere.
Sherlock Holmes.
Of course.
How can I refuse? Lestrade - I've been summoned.
Coming? - If you want me to.
- Of course.
I'd be lost without my blogger.
You like the funny cases, don't you? - The surprising ones.
- Obviously.
- You'll love this.
That explosion.
- Gas leak, yes? - No.
- No? - No.
Made to look like one.
- What? Hardly anything left of the place, except a strongbox.
A very strong box, and inside it was this.
- You haven't opened it? - It's addressed to you, isn't it? We've X-rayed it.
It's not booby-trapped.
How reassuring.
Nice stationery.
Bohemian.
What? From the Czech Republic.
No fingerprints? No.
She used a fountain pen.
Parker Duofold, Meridian nib.
- She? - Obviously.
Obviously.
That That's the phone.
The pink phone.
What, from The Study In Pink? Well, obviously, it's not the same phone, but it's supposed to look like Study In Pink, you read his blog? Of course I read his blog.
We all do.
Do you really not know that the Earth goes round the sun? It isn't the same phone.
This one's brand new.
Someone's gone to a lot of trouble to make it look like the same phone.
Which means your blog has a far wider readership.
You have one new message.
- Was that it? - No, that's not it.
What in the hell are we supposed to make of that? An estate agent's photo and the bloody Greenwich pips.
- It's a warning.
- A warning? Some secret societies used to send dried melon seeds, orange pips, things like that - five pips.
They're warning us it's going to happen again.
- I've seen this place before.
- Hang on.
- What's going to happen again? - Boom! Mrs Hudson? You had a look, didn't you, Sherlock, when you first came - to see about your flat? - The door's been opened.
- Recently.
- No, can't be.
That's the only key.
I can't get anyone interested in this flat.
It's the damp, I expect - that's the curse of basements.
I'd a place once when I was first married.
Black mould all up the wall Oh.
Dear me.
Shoes.
He's a bomber, remember.
Hello.
H-Hellosexy.
Who's this? I'vesent youa little puzzle.
Just to say hi.
Who's talking? Why are you crying? I I'm not crying.
I'm typing.
And thisstupid bitch is reading it out.
The curtain rises.
- What? - Nothing.
- No, what did you mean? - I've been expecting this for some time.
12 hours to solve my puzzle, Sherlock or I'm going to be sonaughty.
- So, who do you suppose it was? - Hmm? Woman on the phone - the crying woman.
Oh, she doesn't matter, she's just a hostage.
No lead there.
For God's sake, I wasn't thinking about leads.
You're not going to be much use to her.
Are they trying to trace it - trace the call? The bomber's too smart for that.
- Pass me my phone.
- Where is it? Jacket.
Careful! Text from your brother.
- Delete it.
- Delete it? Missile plans are out of the country now.
Nothing we can do about it.
Well, Mycroft thinks there is.
He's texted you eight times.
Must be important.
Then why didn't he cancel his dental appointment? His what? Mycroft never texts if he can talk.
Look, Andrew West stole the missile plans, tried to sell them, got his head smashed in for his pains, end of story.
The only mystery is this - why's my brother so determined to bore me when somebody else is being so delightfully interesting? Try and remember there's a woman who might die.
What for? There's hospitals full of people dying, Doctor.
Why don't you go and cry by their bedside and see what good it does them? Ah! - Any luck? - Oh, yes! - Oh, sorry.
I didn't - Jim, hi! Come in! Come in! - Jim, this is Sherlock Holmes.
- Ah.
- And, er Sorry.
- John Watson.
Hi.
Hi.
So, you're Sherlock Holmes.
Molly's told me all about you.
You on one of your cases? Jim works in IT, upstairs.
That's how we met.
Office romance.
Gay.
- Sorry, what? - Nothing.
Um, hey.
Hi.
Sorry.
Sorry! Well, I'd better be off.
I'll see you at the Fox.
- About sixish? - Yeah.
- Bye.
- Bye.
It was nice to meet you.
You too.
What do you mean, gay? We're together.
And domestic bliss must suit you, Molly.
You've put on three pounds since I last saw you.
- Two-and-a-half.
- No, three.
- Sherlock.
- He's not gay! - Why do you have to spoil? He's not! - With that level of personal grooming? Because he puts a bit of product in his hair? I put product in my hair.
You wash your hair, there's a difference.
No, no - tinted eyelashes, clear signs of taurine cream around the frown lines.
Those tired, clubber's eyes.
- Then there's his underwear.
- His underwear? Visible above the waistline.
Very visible.
Very particular brand.
Plus the extremely suggestive fact that he just left his number under this dish.
I'd say you'd better break it off now and save yourself the pain.
Charming, well done Just saving her time.
Isn't that kinder? Kinder? No, no.
Sherlock, that wasn't kind.
Go on, then.
Hm? You know what I do.
Off you go.
- Oh No.
- Go on.
I'm not going to stand here so you can humiliate me - while I try and disseminate - An outside eye, a second opinion.
- It's very useful to me.
- Yeah, right Really! Fine.
Oh, they're just a pair of shoes.
Trainers! Good.
Um They're in good nick.
I'd say they were pretty new, except the sole has been well worn, so the owner must have had them for a while.
Er, very '80s.
Probably one of those retro designs.
You're on sparkling form.
What else? They're quite big.
A man's.
But But there's traces of a name inside in felt-tip.
Adults don't write their names inside their shoes, so these belong to a kid.
Excellent.
What else? Er - That's it.
- That's it.
- How did I do? - Well, John.
Really well.
I mean, you missed almost everything of importance, but, you know The owner loved these.
Scrubbed them clean.
Whitened them where they got discoloured.
Changed the laces three no, four times.
Even so, there are traces of his flaky skin where his fingers have come into contact with them, so he suffered from eczema.
The shoes are well worn, more so on the inner side, which means the owner had weak arches.
British-made, 20 years old.
- 20 years? - They're not retro, they're original.
Limited edition - two blue stripes, 1989.
There's still mud on them.
They look new.
Someone's kept them that way.
Quite a bit of mud caked on the soles.
Analysis shows it's from Sussex with London mud overlaying it.
How do you know? Pollen.
Clear as a map reference to me.
South of the river, too.
So, the kid who owned these trainers came to London from Sussex 20 years ago - and left them behind.
- So, what happened to him? Something bad.
He loved those shoes, remember.
He'd never leave them filthy.
Wouldn't let them go unless he had to.
So, a child with big feet gets Oh! What? Carl Powers.
- Sorry, who? - Carl Powers, John.
What is it? It's where I began.
1989, young kid, champion swimmer, came up from Brighton for a school sports tournament, drowned in the pool.
Tragic accident.
You wouldn't remember it.
- Why should you? - But you remember.
- Yes.
- Something fishy about it? Nobody thought so.
Nobody except me.
I was only a kid myself.
I read about it in the papers.
- You started young, didn't you? - The boy, Carl Powers, had some kind of fit in the water, but by the time they got him out, it was too late.
There was something wrong somewhere and I couldn't get it out of my head.
- What? - His shoes.
- What about them? - They weren't there.
I made a fuss.
I tried to get the police interested but nobody seemed to think it was important.
He'd left all the rest of his clothes in his locker.
But there was no sign of his shoes.
Until now.
Can I help? I want to help.
There's only five hours left.
It's your brother.
He's texting me now.
- How does he know my number? - Must be a root canal.
- Look, he did saynational importance.
- Hmm! - How quaint! - What is? You are.
Queen and country.
- You can't just ignore it.
- I'm not ignoring it.
Putting my best man onto it right now.
Right, good! Who's that? John, how nice! I was hoping it wouldn't be long.
How can I help you? Thank you.
Um, I was wanting to Your brother sent me to collect more facts about the stolen plans - the missile plans.
- Did he? - Yes.
He's investigating now.
He's, erinvestigating away.
Um, I just wondered what else you could tell me about the dead man.
Er, 27.
Clerk at Vauxhall Cross.
MI6.
He was involved in the Bruce-Partington Program in a minor capacity.
Security checks A-OK.
No known terrorist affiliations or sympathies.
Last seen by his fiance 10.
30 yesterday evening.
Lucy, love, I've got to go out.
I've got to see someone.
Westie! He was found at Battersea, yes.
So he got on the train? - No.
- What? He had an Oyster card - but it hadn't been used.
- He must have bought a ticket.
- Hm.
There was no ticket on the body.
- Then Then how did he end up with a bashed-in brain on the tracks at Battersea? That is the question - the one I was rather hoping Sherlock would provide an answer to.
How's he getting on? He's fine.
And it is goingvery well.
He's, um He's completely focused on it.
- Poison! - What are you going on about? Clostridium botulinum.
It's one of the deadliest poisons on the planet.
Carl Powers.
Are you saying he was murdered? - Remember the shoelaces.
- Mmm.
The boy suffered from eczema.
It would be the easiest thing in the world to introduce the poison into his medication.
Two hours later he comes up to London, the poison takes effect, paralyses the muscles and he drowns.
How come the autopsy didn't pick that up? It's virtually undetectable.
Nobody would have been looking for it.
There's still tiny traces of it left inside the trainers from where he put the cream on his feet.
- That's why they had to go.
- So, how do we let the bomber know? Get his attention, stop the clock.
The killer kept the shoes all these years.
Yes.
- Meaning - He's our bomber.
Well done, you.
Come and get me.
Where are you? Tell us where you are.
She lives in Cornwall.
Two men broke in wearing masks, forced her to drive to the car park and decked her out in enough explosives to take down a house.
Told her to phone you.
Check the read-out from this - pager.
If she deviated by one word, the sniper would set her off.
- Or if you hadn't solved the case.
- Oh Elegant! Elegant? What was the point? Why would anyone do this? Oh I can't be the only person in the world that gets bored.
You have one new message.
Four pips.
First test passed, it would seem.
Here's the second.
It's abandoned, wouldn't you say? I'll see if it's been reported.
Freak, it's for you.
Hello.
It's OK that you've gone to the police.
Who is this? Is this you again? But don't rely on them.
Clever you.
Guessing about Carl Powers.
I never liked him.
Carl laughed at me so I stopped him laughing.
You've stolen another voice, I presume.
This is about you and me.
Who are you? What's that noise? It's the sounds of life, Sherlock.
But don't worry.
I can soon fix that.
You solved my last puzzle in nine hours.
This time you have eight.
Great! We've found it.
The car was hired yesterday morning by an Ian Monkford.
Banker of some kind.
City boy.
Paid in cash.
Told his wife he was going away on a business trip and he never arrived.
- You're still hanging round him.
- Yeah, well - Opposites attract, I s'pose.
- We're not - You should get yourself a hobby.
- Stamps, maybe.
Model trains.
Safer.
Before you ask, yes, it's Monkford's blood.
DNA checks out.
- No body.
- Not yet.
Get a sample sent to the lab.
Oh! Mrs Monkford Yes.
Sorry, but I've already spoken with two policemen.
We're not from the police, we're - Sherlock Holmes.
- Very old friend of your husband's.
We, um We grew up together.
I'm sorry.
Who? I don't think he ever mentioned you.
Oh, he must have done.
This is This is horrible.
I mean, I just can't believe it.
I only saw him the other day.
Same old Ian.
Not a care in the world.
Sorry My husband has been depressed for months.
Who are you? Really strange that he hired a car.
Why would he do that? It's a bit suspicious, isn't it? No, it isn't.
He forgot to renew the tax on the car, that's all.
Ah, well! That was Ian.
- That was Ian all over.
- No, it wasn't.
Wasn't it? Interesting.
- Who was I talking to? - Why did you lie to her? People don't like telling you things.
They love to contradict you.
Past tense, did you notice? - Sorry, what? - I referred to her husband in the past tense.
She joined in.
Bit premature.
- They've only just found the car.
- You think she murdered her husband.
Definitely not.
That's not a mistake a murderer would make.
- I see No, I don't.
What am I seeing? - Fishing.
- Try fishing.
- Where now? Janus Cars.
Just found this in the glove compartment.
Can't see how I can help you gentlemen.
Mr Monkford hired the car from you yesterday.
Yeah, lovely motor.
Mazda RX8.
Wouldn't mind one of them myself.
Is that one? No, they're all Jags.
I can see you're not a car man, eh! But surely you can afford one - a Mazda, I mean.
Yeah, that's a fair point.
You know how it is.
It's like working in a sweet shop.
Once you start picking up the Liquorice all sorts, when does it all stop, eh? - You didn't know Mr Monkford.
- No, he was just a client.
He came in here and hired one of my cars.
I've no idea what happened to him.
Poor sod! - Nice holiday, Mr Ewart? - Eh? - You've been away, haven't you? - Oh, the No, it's sunbeds, I'm afraid.
Too busy to get away.
My wife would love it, though - bit of sun.
Have you got any change for the cigarette machine? What? I noticed one on the way in and I haven't got any change.
I'm gasping.
Um Oh! No, sorry.
Oh, well! Thank you very much for your time, Mr Ewart.
You've been very helpful.
Come on, John! I've got change, if you still want to Nicotine patches.
Remember? I'm doing well.
- So, what was all that about? - I needed to look inside his wallet.
- Why? - Mr Ewart's a liar.
Hello.
The clue's in the name - Janus Cars.
Why would you be giving me a clue? Why does anyone do anything? Because I'm bored.
We were made for each other, Sherlock.
- Then talk to me in your own voice.
- Patience.
How much blood was on that seat, would you say? How much? About a pint.
Not about.
Exactly a pint.
That was their first mistake.
The blood's definitely Ian Monkford's, but it's been frozen.
- Frozen? - There are clear signs.
I think Ian Monkford gave a pint of his blood some time ago - and that's what they spread on the seat.
- Who did? Janus Cars.
The clue's in the name.
- The god with two faces? - Exactly.
They provide a very special service.
If you've got any kind of a problem - money troubles, bad marriage, whatever - Janus Cars will help you disappear.
Ian Monkford was up to his eyes in some kind of trouble - financial at a guess, he's a banker - couldn't see a way out.
But if he were to vanish, if the car he hired was found abandoned with his blood all over the driver's seat - So where is he? - Colombia.
- Colombia?! - Mr Ewart, of Janus Cars, had a 20,000 Colombian peso note in his wallet.
Quite a bit of change, too.
He told us he hadn't been abroad recently, but when I asked him about the cars, I could see his tan line clearly.
No-one wears a shirt on a sunbed.
- That, plus his arm.
- His arm? He kept scratching it.
Obviously irritating him, and bleeding.
Why? Because he'd recently had a boosterjab.
Hep-B, probably.
Difficult to tell at that distance.
Conclusion - he'd just come back from settling Ian Monkford into his new life in Colombia.
Mrs Monkford cashes in the life insurance, and she splits it with Janus Cars.
- Mrs Monkford? - Oh, yes.
She's in on it too.
Now, go and arrest them, Inspector, that's what you do best.
We need to let our friendly bomber know that the case is solved.
I am on fire! He says you can come and fetch me.
Help! Help me, please! Feeling better? To be honest, we've hardly stopped for breath since this thing started.
- Has it occurred to you? - Probably.
No, has it occurred to you that the bomber's playing a game with you? The envelope, breaking into the other flat, the dead kid's shoes - it's all meant for you.
Yes, I know.
Is it him, then? Moriarty? Perhaps.
- That could be anybody.
- Well, it could be, yeah.
Lucky for you, I've been more than a little unemployed.
- How d'you mean? - Lucky for you, Mrs Hudson and I watch far too much telly.
Thank you, Tyra! Doesn't she look lovely, everybody, now? Anyway Speaking of silk purses - Hello? - This one is a bit defective.
Sorry.
She's blind.
This is a funny one.
I'll give you 12 hours.
Why are you doing this? I like to watch you dance.
And I see you're back to your bad habits.
continuing into the sudden death of the popular TV personality Connie Prince.
Miss Prince, famous for her makeover programmes, was found dead two days ago by her brother in the house they shared in Ham Connie Prince, 54, she had one of those makeover shows on the telly.
- Did you see it? - No.
- Very popular, she was going places.
- Not any more.
So, dead two days.
According to one of her staff, Raoul de Santos, she cut her hand on a rusty nail in the garden.
Nasty wound.
Tetanus bacteria enters the bloodstream, good night, Vienna.
I s'pose.
Something's wrong with this picture.
Eh? Can't be as simple as it seems, otherwise the bomber wouldn't be directing us towards it.
Something's wrong.
- John? - Mm.
Cut on her hand, it's deep.
Would have bled a lot, right? - Yeah.
- But the wound's clean.
Very clean, and fresh.
How long would the bacteria have been incubating inside her? Ooh, eight, ten days.
The cut was made later.
- After she was dead? - Must have been.
The only question is, how did the tetanus enter the dead woman's system? - You want to help, right? - Of course.
Connie Prince's background - family history, everything, give me data.
Right.
There's something else that we haven't thought of.
- Is there? - Yes.
Why is he doing this, the bomber? If this woman's death was suspicious, why point it up? - Good Samaritan.
- Who press-gangs suicide bombers? - Bad Samaritan.
- I'm I'm serious, Sherlock.
Listen, I'm cutting you slack here, I'm trusting you, but out there somewhere, some poor bastard's covered in Semtex and he's just waiting for you to solve the puzzle, so just tell me - what are we dealing with? Something new.
Connection, connection, connection.
There must be a connection.
Carl Powers, killed 20 years ago.
The bomber knew him, admitted that he knew him.
The bomber's iPhone was in the stationery from the Czech Republic.
The first hostage from Cornwall, the second from London, the third from Yorkshire, judging by her accent.
What's he doing? Working his way round the world, showing off? You're enjoying this, aren't you? Joining thedots.
Three hours.
Boomboom.
We're devastated, of course we are.
Can I get you anything, sir? Er, no.
No, thanks.
Raoul is my rock.
I don't think I could have managed.
We didn't always see eye to eye but my sister was very dear to me.
And to the, er, public, Mr Prince.
Oh, she was adored.
I've seen her take girls who looked like the back end of Routemasters and turn them into princesses.
Still, it's a relief, in a way, to know that she's beyond this veil of tears.
Absolutely.
Great.
Thank you.
Thanks again.
It's a real shame.
I liked her.
She taught you how to do your colours.
- Colours? - You know, what goes best with what.
I should never wear cerise, apparently.
- Drains me.
- Who's that? - Home Office.
- Home Office? Well, Home Secretary, actually.
Owes me a favour.
She was a pretty girl, but she messed about with herself too much.
They all do these days.
People can hardly move their faces.
It's silly, isn't it? - Did you ever see her show? - Not until now.
You look pasty, love.
Ah, rained every day but one That's the brother.
No love lost there, - if you can believe the papers.
- So I gather.
I've just been having a very fruitful chat with people who love this show.
- The fan site's indispensable for gossip.
- really only one thing we can do with that ensemble, don't you think, girls? Off, off, off, off, off, off, off! Yeah, it's more common than people think.
The tetanus is in the soil, people cut themselves on rose bushes, garden forks, that sort of thing, if left untreated - I don't know what I'm going to do now.
- Right.
I mean, she's left me this place which is lovely but it's not the same without her.
That's why my paper wanted to get the, ermthe full story straight from the horse's mouth.
Are you sure it's not too soon? - No.
- Right.
You fire away.
John.
Hi.
Look, get over here quickly.
I think I'm onto something.
You'll need to pick up some stuff first.
Have you got a pen? I'll remember.
- That'll be him.
- What? - Ah, Mr Prince, isn't it? - Yes.
- Very good to meet you.
- Yes, thank you.
- So sorry to hear about - Yes, yes, very kind.
Shall we, er? You were right, the bacteria got into her another way.
- Oh, yes? - Yes.
- Right, are we all set? - Er, yes.
Shall we, erm? Er, not too close.
I'm raw from crying.
Oh, who's this? Sekhmet.
Named after the Egyptian goddess.
How nice.
Was she Connie's? Yes, a little present from yours truly.
Sherlock, light reading? Oh, er - Bloody hell! What are you playing at? - Sorry! You're like Laurel and bloody Hardy, you two! What's going on? Actually, I think we've got what we came for.
Excuse us.
- What? - Sherlock.
- What? - We've got deadlines.
But you've not taken anything! Yes! Ooh, yes! You think it was the cat.
It wasn't the cat.
What? Yes.
Yeah, it is.
It must be.
It's how he got the tetanus into her system.
- Its paws stink of disinfectant.
- Lovely idea.
No, he coated it onto the claws of her cat.
It's a new pet, bound to be a bit jumpy around her.
A scratch is almost inevitable.
She wouldn't I thought of it the minute I saw the scratches on her arm, but it's too random and too clever for the brother.
He murdered his sister for her money.
- Did he? - Didn't he? Nope.
It was revenge.
- Rev? Who wanted revenge? - Raoul, the houseboy.
Kenny Prince was the butt of his sister's jokes week in, week out.
Virtual bullying campaign.
Finally, he had enough, fell out with her badly.
It's all on the website.
She threatened to disinherit Kenny, Raoul had grown accustomed - to a certain lifestyle - Wait.
Wait! Wait a second.
What about the disinfectant, then, on the cat's claws? Raoul keeps a very clean house.
You came through the kitchen door, saw the state of that floor - scrubbed within an inch of its life.
You smell of disinfectant.
I know the cat doesn't come into it.
Raoul's internet records do, though.
I hope we can get a cab from here.
Raoul de Santos is your killer.
Kenny Prince's houseboy.
Second autopsy shows it wasn't tetanus that poisoned Connie Prince, it was botulinum toxin.
We've been here before.
Carl Powers.
Tut-tut.
- Our bomber's repeated himself.
- So how'd he do it? - Botox injection.
- Botox? Botox is a diluted form of botulinum.
Among other things, Raoul de Santos was employed to give Connie her regular facial injections.
My contact at the Home Office gave me the complete records of Raoul's internet purchases.
He's been bulk ordering Botox for months.
Bided his time, then upped the strength to a fatal dose.
- Are you sure about this? - I'm sure.
All right, my office.
- Hey, Sherlock, how long? - What? - How long have you known? - Well, this one was quite simple.
And like I said, the bomber repeated himself.
That was a mistake.
No, but, Sherlock, the hostage, the old woman, she's been there all this time! I knew I could save her.
I also knew that the bomber had given us 12 hours.
I solved the case quickly, that gave me time to get on with other things.
Don't you see? We're one up on him.
Hello.
Help me! Tell us where you are.
- Address? - He was so His voice No, no, no, no! Tell me nothing about him, nothing.
He sounded so soft.
Hello? Sherlock? What's happened? The explosion, which ripped through several floors, killing 12 people - Old block of flats.
- caused by a faulty gas main.
A spokesman from the utility company - He certainly gets about.
- Well, obviously I lost that round.
Although technically, I did solve the case.
He killed the old lady because she started to describe him.
Just once, he put himself in the firing line.
What d'you mean? Well, usually, he must stay above it all.
He organises these things, but no-one ever has direct contact.
What, like the Connie Prince murder, he arranged that? So, people come to him wanting their crimes fixed up, like booking a holiday? Novel.
Huh! Taking his time this time.
Anything on the Carl Powers case? Nothing.
All the living classmates check out spotless, no connection.
- Maybe the killer was older than Carl? - The thought had occurred.
So why is he doing this, then? Playing this game with you.
Do you think he wants to be caught? - I think he wants to be distracted.
- Oh I hope you'll be very happy together.
- Sorry, what? - There are lives at stake, Sherlock.
Actual human lives! Just so I know, - do you care about that at all? - Will caring about them help save them? Nope.
Then I'll continue not to make that mistake.
- And you find that easy, do you? - Yes, very.
- Is that news to you? - No, no.
I've disappointed you.
That's good, that's a good deduction, yeah.
Don't make people into heroes, John.
Heroes don't exist, and if they did, I wouldn't be one of them.
Excellent.
A view of the Thames.
South Bank, somewhere between Southwark Bridge and Waterloo.
You check the papers, I'll look online.
Oh, you're angry with me, so you won't help.
Not much cop, this caring lark.
- Archway suicide - Ten-a-penny.
Two kids stabbed in Stoke Newington.
Ah, man found on the train line, Andrew West.
Nothing! It's me.
Have you found anything on the South Bank between Waterloo Bridge and Southwark Bridge? Do you reckon this is connected, then, the bomber? Must be.
Odd, though, he hasn't been in touch.
Then we must assume that some poor bugger's primed to explode, yeah? Yes.
- Any ideas? - Seven, so far.
Seven? He's dead about 24 hours.
Maybe a bit longer.
Did he drown? Apparently not.
Not enough of the Thames in his lungs, asphyxiated.
Yes, I'd agree.
There's quite a bit of bruising around the nose and mouth.
More bruises here and here.
Fingertips.
He's late 30s, I'd say, not in the best condition.
He's been in the river a long while, the water's destroyed most of the data.
But I'll tell you one thing, that lost Vermeer painting's a fake.
- What? - We need to identify the corpse, find out about his friends and Wait, wait, wait, wait.
What painting? What are you on about? It's all over the place, haven't you seen the posters? Dutch old master, supposed to have been destroyed centuries ago.
Now it's turned up, worth 30 million.
OK, so what has that got to do with the stiff? Everything.
- Have you ever heard of the Golem? - Golem? It's a horror story, isn't it? What are you saying? Jewish folk story, a gigantic man made of clay, it's also the name of an assassin.
Real name - Oskar Dzundza.
One of the deadliest assassins in the world.
That is his trademark style.
- So this is a hit? - Definitely.
The Golem squeezes the life out of his victims with his bare hands.
But what has this got to do with that painting? I don't see You do see, you just don't observe! Yes, all right, all right, girls! Calm down.
Sherlock, do you want to take us through it? What do we know about this corpse? The killer's not left us with much, just the shirt and the trousers.
They're pretty formal, maybe he was going out for the night.
The trousers are heavy duty.
Polyester, nasty, same as the shirt, cheap.
They're both too big for him.
So some kind of standard-issue uniform.
Dressed for work, then.
What kind of work? There's a hook on his belt for a walkie-talkie.
Tube driver? - Security guard? - More likely.
- That'll be borne out by his backside.
- Backside?! Flabby, you'd think he led a sedentary life.
Yet the soles of his feet and the nascent varicose veins in his legs show otherwise.
So, a lot of walking and a lot of sitting around.
Security guard's looking good.
The watch helps too.
The alarm shows he did regular night shifts.
Why regular? Maybe he set his alarm like that the night before he died? No, no, no.
The buttons are stiff, hardly touched.
He set his alarm like that a long time ago, his routine never varied.
But there's something else.
The killer must have been interrupted, otherwise he would have stripped the corpse completely.
There was some kind of badge or insignia on the shirt front that he tore off, suggesting the dead man works somewhere recognisable, some kind of institution.
I found this inside his trouser pockets.
Sodden by the river, but still recognisably - Tickets? - Ticket stubs.
He worked in a museum or gallery.
Did a quick check.
The Hickman Gallery has reported one of its attendants as missing, Alex Woodbridge.
Tonight, they unveil the rediscovered masterpiece.
Now, why would anyone want to pay the Golem to suffocate a perfectly ordinary gallery attendant? Inference, the dead man knew something about it, something that would stop the owner getting paid 30 million.
- The pictures are fake.
- Fantastic.
- Meretricious.
- And a Happy New Year.
Poor sod.
I'd better get my feelers out for this Golem character.
Pointless, you'll never find him, but I know a man who can.
- Who? - Me.
Why hasn't he phoned? He's broken his pattern.
Why? - Waterloo Bridge.
- Where now, the gallery? In a bit.
The Hickman's contemporary art, isn't it? Why have they got hold of an old master? Don't know.
Dangerous to jump to conclusions.
Need data Stop! Can you wait here? I won't be a moment.
Sherlock? Change? Any change? - What for? - Cup of tea, of course.
Here you go, a 50.
Thanks.
- What are you doing? - Investing.
Now we go to the gallery.
Have you got any cash? No, I need you to find out all you can about the gallery attendant.
- Lestrade will give you the address.
- OK.
We'd been sharing about a year.
- Just sharing.
- Mmm.
- May I? - Yeah.
Sorry.
Stargazer, was he? God, yeah.
Mad about it.
It's all he ever did in his spare time.
He was a nice guy, Alex.
I liked him.
He was, er never much of a one for hoovering.
What about art? Did he know anything about that? It was just a job, you know? Mmm.
Has anyone else been round asking about Alex? No.
We had a break-in, though.
- When? - Last night.
There was nothing taken.
Oh, there was a message left for Alex on the land line.
- Who was it from? - I can play it for you, if you like.
- I'll get the phone - Please.
Oh, should I speak now? Alex? Love, it's Professor Cairns.
Listen, you were right.
You were bloody right.
Give us a call when Professor Cairns? - No idea, sorry.
- Mmm.
Can I try and ring back? No good.
I've had other calls since.
Sympathy ones, you know.
Don't you have something to do? Just admiring the view.
Yes.
Lovely.
Now go back to work - we open tonight.
- Doesn't it bother you? - What? That the painting's a fake.
- What? - It's a fake.
It has to be.
It's the only possible explanation.
You are in charge, aren't you, Miss Wenceslas? Who are you? Alex Woodbridge knew that the painting was a fake, so somebody sent the Golem to take care of him.
Was it you? Golem? What the hell are you talking about? Are you working for someone else? Did you fake it for them? It's not a fake.
It is a fake.
I don't know why.
But there's something wrong with it, there has to be.
What the hell are you on about? You know I could have you - sacked on the spot.
- Not a problem.
- No? - No, I don't work here, you see.
Just popped in to give you a bit of friendly advice.
How did you get in? - Please! - I want to know.
The art of disguise is knowing how to hide in plain sight.
- Who are you? - Sherlock Holmes.
Am I supposed to be impressed? You should be.
Have a nice day.
He wouldn't.
He just wouldn't.
- Stranger things have happened.
- Westie wasn't a traitor.
It's a horrible thing to say! I'm sorry.
But you must understand That's what they think, isn't it, his bosses? He was young man, about to get married, he had debts.
Everyone's got debts, and Westie wouldn't want to clear them by selling out his country.
Can you, erm? Can you tell me exactly what happened that night? We were having a night in.
Justwatching a DVD.
He normally falls asleep, you know, but he sat through this one.
He was quiet.
Out of the blue he said he just had to go and see someone.
And you've no idea who? Hi, Liz.
You OK, love? - Yeah.
- Who's this? - John Watson, hi.
- This is my brother, Joe.
John's trying to find out what happened to Westie, Joe.
- You with the police? - Sort of, yeah.
Tell them to get off their arses, will you? It's bloody ridiculous.
I'll do my best.
Well, er, thanks very much for your help.
Again, I'm very, very sorry.
He didn't steal those things, Mr Watson.
I knew Westie, he was a good man.
He was my good man.
- Spare change? - No.
Any spare change? Alex Woodbridge didn't know anything special about art.
- And? - And Is that it? No habits, hobbies, personality? Give us a chance.
He was an amateur astronomer.
- Hold that cab.
- Spare change, sir? - Don't mind if I do.
- Can you wait here? Fortunately, I haven't been idle.
Come on.
Beautiful, isn't it? - I thought you didn't care about - Doesn't mean I can't appreciate it.
Listen, Alex Woodbridge had a message on the answerphone at his flat.
- A Professor Cairns.
- This way.
Nice.
Nice part of town.
- Any time you want to explain? - Homeless network.
- Really is indispensable.
- Homeless network? My eyes and ears, all over the city.
Ah, that'sclever.
- So you scratch their backs, and? - Yes, then disinfect myself.
Sherlock! Come on! What's he doing sleeping rough? Well, he has a very distinctive look.
He has to hide somewhere where tongues won't wagmuch.
- Oh - What? - I wish I - Don't mention it.
No! No! No! No! It'll take us weeks to find him again.
Or not.
I have an idea where he might be going.
- What? - I told you, someone left Alex Woodbridge a message.
There can't be that many Professor Cairns in the book.
Come on.
Jupiter, the fifth planet in our solar system, and the largest.
Jupiter is a gas giant.
Planet Earth would fit into it 11 times.
Yes, we know that.
- Titan is the largest moon - Come on, Neptune.
Many are actually long dead - Tom, is that you? - exploded into supernovas.
Discovered by Urbain Le Verrier in 1846 composed mainly of hydrogen.
Their light takes so long to reach us - Golem! - many are actually long dead, exploded into I can't see him.
- I'll go round.
- Who are you working for, Dzundza? A star begins as a collapsing ball of material - composed mainly of - Golem! Let him go or I will kill you.
The fourth planet of the solar system, named after the Roman God of War.
it is a gas giant takes so long to reach us into supernovas exploded into supernovas - It's a fake.
It has to be.
- That painting has been subjected to - every test known to science.
- It's a very good fake, then.
You know about this, don't you? This is you, isn't it? Inspector, my time is being wasted.
Would you mind showing yourself and your friends out? The painting is a fake.
It's a fake, that's why Woodbridge and Cairns were killed.
Oh, come on, proving it's just a detail.
The painting is a fake.
I've solved it, I've figured it out.
It's a fake, that's the answer, that's why they were killed.
OK, I'll prove it.
Give me time.
Will you give me time? - 10 - It's a kid.
- Oh God, it's a kid.
- What did he say? - 1 0.
- 9.
He's giving me time.
- Jesus - It's a fake, but how can I prove it? - How?! How?! - 8.
This kid will die.
Tell me why the painting is a fake.
Tell me! - 7.
- No, shut up.
Don't say anything.
It only works if I figure it out.
It must be possible.
It must be staring me in the face.
- 6.
- How? Woodbridge knew, but how?! - 5.
- It's speeding up! Sherlock! - 4.
- In the Planetarium, you heard it too.
Oh, that is brilliant, that is gorgeous! - 3.
- What's brilliant? What is?! This is beautiful.
- Sherlock! - The Van Buren Supernova.
Please, is somebody there? Somebody help me.
There you go.
Go and find out where he is and pick him up.
Van Buren Supernova, so-called.
Exploding star.
Only appeared in the sky in 1858.
So how could it have been painted in the 1640s? Oh Oh.
Oh, Sherl You know, it's interesting.
Bohemian stationery, an assassin named after a Prague legend, and you, Miss Wenceslas.
This whole case has a distinctly Czech feeling about it.
Is that where this leads? What are we looking at, Inspector? Well, criminal conspiracy, fraud, accessory after the fact, at the very least.
The murder of the old woman, all the people in the flat I didn't know anything about that.
All those things, please, believe me.
I just wanted my share.
The 30 million.
I found a little old man in Argentina.
A genius - I mean, really.
Brushwork, immaculate.
- Could fool anyone.
- Mmm.
Well, nearly anyone.
But I didn't know how to go about convincing the world the picture was genuine.
It was just an idea.
A spark which he blew into a flame.
Who? I don't know.
It's true! It took a long time, but eventually I was put in touch with people.
His people Well, there was never any real contact.
Just messages whispers.
And did those whispers have a name? Moriarty.
- So this is where West was found? - Yeah.
- Are you going to be long? - I might be.
- Are you the police, then? - Sort of.
- I hate 'em.
- The police? No, jumpers.
People who chuck 'emselves in front of trains.
Selfish bastards.
Well, that's one way of looking at it.
I mean it.
It's all right for them.
It's over in a split second, strawberry jam all over the lines.
What about the drivers, eh? They've got to live with it, haven't they? Yeah, speaking of strawberry jam, there's no blood on the line.
- Has it been cleaned off? - No, there wasn't that much.
You said his head was smashed in.
It was, but there wasn't much blood.
- OK.
- Well, I'll leave you to it, then.
- Just give us a shout when you're off.
- Right.
Right, so, Andrew West got on the train somewhere.
Or did he? There was no ticket on the body.
How did he end up here? - The points.
- Yes! I knew you'd get there eventually.
West wasn't killed here, that's why there was so little blood.
- How long have you been following me? - Since the start.
You don't think I'd give up on a case like this just to spite my brother, do you? Come on, we've got a bit of burglary to do.
Missile defence plans haven't left the country, otherwise Mycroft's people would have heard about it.
Despite what people think, we do still have a secret service.
Yeah, I know, I've met them.
Which means whoever stole the memory stick can't sell it or doesn't know what to do with it.
My money's on the latter.
We're here.
Where? Sherlock! What if there's someone in? There isn't.
Jesus - Where are we? - Oh, sorry, didn't I say? Joe Harrison's flat.
Joe? Brother of West's fiance.
He stole the memory stick, killed his prospective brother-in-law.
Then why did he do it? Let's ask him.
Don't! Don't.
He wasn't meant to What's Lucy gonna say? Jesus.
Why did you kill him? It was an accident.
I swear it was.
But stealing the plans for the missile defence program wasn't an accident, was it? I started dealing drugs.
I mean, the bike thing's a great cover, right? I don't know how it started.
I just got out of my depth.
I owed people thousands.
Serious people.
Then at Westie's engagement do, he starts talking about his job.
I mean, usually, he's so careful.
But that night, after a few pints, he really opened up.
He told me about these missile plans.
Beyond top secret.
He showed me the memory stick, he waved it in front of me.
You hear about these things getting lost, ending up on rubbish tips and whatnot.
But there it was.
And I thought Well, I thought it could be worth a fortune.
It was pretty easy to get the thing off him, he was so plastered.
Next time I saw him, I could tell by the look on his face that he knew.
- What are you doing here? - What have you done with the plans? What happened? I was going to call an ambulance, but it was too late.
I just didn't have a clue what to do.
So I dragged him in 'ere.
I just sat in the dark, thinking.
When a neat little idea popped into your head.
Carrying Andrew West way away from here.
His body would have gone on for ages if the train hadn't hit a stretch of track with curves.
- And points.
- Exactly.
Do you still have it, then - the memory stick? Fetch it for me, if you wouldn't mind.
Distraction over - the game continues.
Maybe that's over, too.
We've heard nothing from the bomber.
Five pips, remember, John.
It's a countdown.
We've only had four.
No, no, no! Course he's not the boy's father.
Look at the turn-ups on his jeans! - I knew it was dangerous.
- Hm? Getting you into crap telly.
Not a patch on Connie Prince.
Have you given Mycroft the memory stick yet? Yep.
He was over the moon.
Threatened me with a knighthoodagain.
- You know, I'm still waiting.
- Hm? For you to admit that a little knowledge of the solar system and you'd have cleared up the fake painting a lot quicker.
It didn't do you any good, did it? No, but I'm not the world's only consulting detective.
- True.
- I won't be in for tea.
I'm going to Sarah's.
There's still some of that risotto left in the fridge.
- Milk, we need milk.
- I'll get some.
- Really? - Really.
- And some beans, then? - Mm.
Bought you a little getting-to-know-you present.
That's what it's all been for, isn't it? All your little puzzles, making me dance.
All to distract me from this.
Evening.
This is a turn-up, isn't it, Sherlock? - John! What the hell? - Bet you never saw this coming.
Whatwould you like me to make him saynext? Gottle o' gear, gottle o' gear, - gottle o' gear.
- Stop it.
Nice touch, this.
The pool, where little Carl dies.
I stopped him.
I can stop John Watson, too.
- Stop his heart.
- Who are you? I gave you my number.
I thought you might call.
Is that a British Army Browning L9A1 in your pocket, or are you just pleased to see me? Both.
Jim Moriarty.
Hi.
Jim? Jim from the hospital? Oh, did I really make such a fleeting impression? But then, I suppose, that was rather the point.
Don't be silly.
Someone else is holding the rifle.
I don't like getting my hands dirty.
I've given you a glimpse, Sherlock, just a teensy glimpse of what I've got going on out there in the big bad world.
I'm a specialist, you see.
Like you.
Dear Jim please will you fix it for me to get rid of my lover's nasty sister? Dear Jim, please will you fix it for me to disappear to South America? Just so.
Consulting criminal.
- Brilliant.
- Isn't it? No-one ever gets to me.
And no-one ever will.
I did.
You've come the closest.
Now you're in my way.
- Thank you.
- Didn't mean it as a compliment.
- Yes, you did.
- Yeah, OK, I did.
But the flirting's over, Sherlock.
Daddy's had enough now.
I've shown you what I can do.
I cut loose all those people, all those little problems, even 30 million quid, just to get you to come out and play.
So take this as a friendly warning my dear.
Back off.
Although I have loved this, this little game of ours.
Playing Jim from IT.
Playing gay.
Did you like the little touch with the underwear? - People have died.
- That's what people do! - I will stop you.
- No, you won't.
Are you all right? You can talk, Johnny boy.
Go ahead.
- Take it.
- Mm? Oh that? The missile plans.
Boring! I could have got them anywhere.
- Sherlock, run! - Good! Very good.
If your sniper pulls that trigger, Mr Moriarty, then we both go up.
Isn't he sweet? I can see why you like having him around.
But then, people do get so sentimental about their pets.
They're so touchingly loyal.
But oops! You've rather shown your hand there, Dr Watson.
Gotcha.
Westwood.
Do you know what happens if you don't leave me alone, Sherlock? To you? Oh, let me guess.
I get killed.
Kill you? No, don't be obvious.
I mean, I'm going to kill you anyway, some day.
I don't want to rush it, though.
I'm saving it up for something special.
No, no, no, no, no.
If you don't stop prying, I'll burn you.
I'll burn the heart out of you.
I have been reliably informed that I don't have one.
But we both know that's not quite true.
Well, I'd better be off.
Well, so nice to have had a proper chat.
What if I was to shoot you now? Right now? Then you could cherish the look of surprise on my face.
Cos I'd be surprised, Sherlock.
Really, I would.
And just a teensy bitdisappointed.
And of course, you wouldn't be able to cherish it for very long.
Ciao, Sherlock Holmes.
Catch youlater.
No, you won't! All right? Are you all right? Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm fine.
Sherlock Sherlock! Oh, Christ.
- Are you OK? - Me? Yeah, fine.
I'm fine.
Fine.
That, erthing that you that you did, that, umyou offered to do that was, umgood.
- I'm glad no-one saw that.
- Mm? You ripping my clothes off in a darkened swimming pool.
People might talk.
They do little else.
- Oh - Sorry, boys.
I'm so changeable! It is a weakness with me, but to be fair to myself, it is my only weakness.
You can't be allowed to continue.
You just can't.
I would try to convince you, but everything I have to say has already crossed your mind.
MAN: Turning over.
585, take one, A camera.
Action! S.
MOFFAT (creator) : This all began on the train to Cardiff, appropriately enough, because Mark and I were both working on different episodes of Doctor Who.
And we'd sit on the train together - we always get the train together so we can chat - and we talked about our other great obsession, which was Sherlock Holmes.
The name's Sherlock Holmes and the address is 221 B Baker Street.
We did this little dance, not literally, in the compartment, around the fact that our favourite Sherlock Holmes is still the Basil Rathbone/Nigel Bruce movies of the '30s and '40s.
We thought they were actually rather more fun, and in certain ways, in certain tonal ways, certain humorous ways, truer to the originals than many grander and more important film versions.
And what we kept saying to each other was, "Someday, someone is going to think of doing that again.
"Someday, someone is going to do Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson "in the modern day.
" And we thought, "And we'll feel so cross, because we should have done it.
" And we had this conversation, I don't know, 20-odd times, probably, over years.
And then suddenly, it formed very quickly, the idea, in a very exciting train journey, and in a very Sherlock Holmes way.
I'm sure we were sitting either side of the compartment, going like that.
It was a proper Sherlock Holmes journey.
The idea of blowing away the fog from it.
And I once mentioned it to my wife, Sue, who said, "Well, why don't you do it?" And it was a kind of light-bulb moment, if you like.
"We should just do this present-day.
" And that's when it properly began.
We actually started focusing on putting it together, as opposed to bemoaning the fact that someone else was bound to do it first.
- You read his blog? - Of course I read his blog.
We all do.
You've brought me here to send a text.
[GUNSHOTS] It seemed to us - and this is just our point of view - that it's become so much about the trappings, about the hansom cabs, the costume, the fog, Jack the Ripper will creep in here It's become a sort of strange maelstrom of stuff.
There's a wealth of Victorian Sherlocks out there and I love them.
There are tons of them.
Why not just try it in the modern day and see how it works? And I think the clinching moment for both of us, and for everyone else we'd spoken to, was when we realised, if we took the story from the beginning, that the original stories began with Dr John Watson being invalided home from Afghanistan, and we realised, well, of course, that could happen just as easily today.
Watson! [EXPLOSIONS] Watson, in this scenario, it's the same in the book, he comes back from Kandahar, from war, but rather like a lot of the clever adaptations, what's changed about it is obviously it's a modern context, so instead of writing a journal, he's keeping a blog MOFFAT : One of the fun things is, as you update it, as you find each equivalent, you think I remember Mark thinking, "He wouldn't write a journal now, he wouldn't write memoirs.
"He'd write a blog.
" And suddenly you realise, of course, that tells you what memoirs were.
They were blogs.
And he wouldn't have teams of homeless children.
He'd have homeless people on the streets selling the Big Issue.
- Spare change, sir? - Don't mind if I do.
MOFFAT: In a way, it allows you to see the original stories the way the original reader would have read them - as exciting, cutting-edge, contemporary stories, as opposed to these relics that they've become.
And it's just endless fun to take the little details and realise how easily, how neatly they update.
X1 004, take five.
Action! [PHONE RINGS] Hello? [WOMAN CRIES] HelloSexy.
Who is this? I'vesent you a little puzzle.
[SNIFFS] Just to say hi.
Who's talking? Why are you crying? I'm not.
I'm not crying.
I'mtyping.
And this stupidbitch is reading it out.
MOFFAT: I suppose one should feel extra pressure if you're adapting or working on something that you've always loved, but the truth is, that is so completely blotted out and obscured by the fact it's, "Ooh, it's our turn.
We get to do it now.
"It's me and Mark doing our Sherlock Holmes series.
" And we still giggle like schoolgirls that we've got this.
So, yeah, the pressure's there.
The pressure's always there.
Who cares about pressure? It's the fun.
It's the absolute joy that 221 B Baker Street is our address, just for this little while.
And that's too exciting to be worried about the pressure.
GATISS: I think that sometimes, as with James Bond, there are half a dozen possible Bonds.
Sometimes there's just one.
And Benedict just sort of leapt into our minds.
Benedict was a hugely simple decision for us.
Sue and I were watching Atonement.
We saw Benedict Cumberbatch.
We were thinking, "Oh, he looks like a Sherlock Holmes.
" Mark knows Benedict.
He instantly thought that was a good idea, so we just sent the script to him and he came in and read for us, and we all thought, "Well, it's just not going to get better than that, is it? "That's perfect.
" And we cast him.
He is the only person ever to have been sent that script for the part of Sherlock Holmes, and the only person to audition for it.
So it was as simple as that.
There's a huge honour to be asked to play that in the first place, but you have to be careful.
Your vanity can trick you into taking the wrong job sometimes.
So you always read the script.
That's the main thing you go to.
And they're justsublime.
It's a murder.
All of them.
I don't know how, I don't know how, but they're not suicides - they're killings.
Serial killings.
We've got a serial killer.
Oh, I love those.
Something to look forward to.
It's a wonderful combination of playing a hero who isa faulted human being.
There's an awful lot of him that is dangerous and perverse and interesting and great stuff to get your teeth into as an actor, and at the same time, he is a Class A hero, you know? Sorry, Mrs Hanson, I'll skip the tea.
Off out.
Both of you? Possible suicides, four of them.
There's no point sitting at home when there's finally something fun going on! Look at you, all happy.
It's not decent.
Who cares about decent? The game, Mrs Hudson, is on.
Casting John Watson was a much longer process because I think once you've got one side of the partnership, you've got to find the fit.
The clincher with Martin was, the chemistry was instant.
Martin's presence in the room changed the way Benedict played the part.
It was again a very, very easy decision.
You saw them standing together and said, "Oh, well, that's a television series, right there.
" What's this about, the case? - Her case.
- Her case? Suitcase, yes, obviously.
The murderer took her suitcase.
First big mistake.
OK.
He took her case.
So? It's no use.
There's no other way.
I'll have to risk it.
There's a phone number on my desk.
I want you to send a text.
I suppose, with John and Sherlock, chemistry either happens or not and you can't really manufacture it and you can't really do anything but hope it's going to happen.
You're a doctor.
In fact, you're an army doctor.
Yes.
Any good? Very good.
Seen a lot of injuries, then? Violent deaths? Hmm, yes.
Bit of trouble, too, I bet? Of course.
Yes.
Enough for a lifetime.
Far too much.
Want to see some more? Oh, God, yes.
And I'd liked Benedict from a distance.
I'd liked his work for a long time.
And I was looking forward to working with him.
But then there's no guarantee you'll work well together, and thank God we have, really, you know.
Because, yeah, we're two quite different people with I guess we're quite different actors.
I think we want to arrive at the same place, which is hopefully not too showy, not too, erhammy.
I think there was a friendship instantly between Martin and Benedict.
They're not at all like the parts they play, at all, really.
But the relationship between them really informs the much pricklier on-screen relationship.
Because obviously, Sherlock's a quite cruel man at times and John's quite a put-upon man at times.
And you won't buy that, you won't enjoy that unless you absolutely feel in every scene, in every heartbeat, that there is that proper underlying warmth, that real, proper, solid friendship.
And that friendship has actually happened between Benedict and Martin.
And the value of that, you get on screen.
It's such a close relationship, Watson and Holmes, and I think for all their adversity and the prickliness of Holmes and how that does often come well, sometimes comes to a crisis, at least, with Watson and Holmes, in order for that to really work on screen it's got to be with two actors who get on well.
- Sorry, what? - There are lives at stake, Sherlock.
Actual human lives.
Just so I know, do you care about that at all? - Will caring about them help save them? - No.
Then I'll continue not to make that mistake.
- And you find that easy, do you? - Yes, very.
Is that news to you? No.
No.
I've disappointed you.
Good.
That's a good deduction, yeah.
Don't make people into heroes, John.
Heroes don't exist, and if they did, I wouldn't be one of them.
Conan Doyle's genius in creating those characters is the friendship between the unlikely friendship between Holmes and Watson.
Sherlock Holmes and John Watson are a fantastic pairing.
They are in many ways not quite chalk and cheese, but they complement each other, really.
It's not a thing of difference being a problem, it's the thing that allies them.
They are the missing half of either party.
- What am I doing here? - Helping me make a point.
I'm supposed to be helping you pay the rent.
- Yeah, well, this is more fun.
- Fun? There's a woman lying dead.
Perfectly sound analysis, but I was hoping you'd go deeper.
Unbeknown to them, like any sort of great relationship or any great chemistry, without knowing it, they realise they've met the right person.
By the end of the first night they've spent together hanging out, they realise that they're going to be very, very good friends.
Because they're a perfect foil for each other.
John is In a way, he's like Sherlock's kind of moral compass.
Because Sherlock's mind is so genuinely brilliant, he doesn't always stop to consider the whys and wherefores or the rights and wrongs of what is.
And John is kind of like his moral barometer there.
And he's a more decent person in a way than Sherlock, because he's more normal.
Sherlock is genuinely extraordinary.
GATISS: We wanted to fetishise modern London in the way, I suppose, that period versions fetishise Victorian London.
Episode 2, which is largely set in the City, we wanted to capture the look of the Gherkin and all those kind of big, glass-and-steel cathedrals of finance.
It's part of a vibrancy which is very exciting to see.
Why have we come to London? Well, because Cardiff has incredible shootability, a word I've just coined for all kinds of things.
Particularly the huge theatre spaces, the amazing epic-looking places.
And also some great matches for parts of London.
But obviously, there are certain things, like the architecture of Baker Street, which you can't really fake.
The whole point is to reinvent Sherlock Holmes as a modern man.
We want his London to be a vibrant and thrilling place.
So we want to have as much of the benefit of these locations as possible.
Action! Action! Hello.
- Ah, Mr Holmes.
- Sherlock, please.
Well, this is a prime spot.
Must be expensive.
Mrs Hudson, the landlady, she's given me a special deal.
Owes me a favour.
A few years back her husband got himself sentenced to death in Florida.
I was able to help out.
Sorry, you stopped her husband being executed? Oh, no, I ensured it.
MRS HUDSON: Sherlock, hello! Mrs Hudson, Dr John Watson.
- Hello.
Come in.
- Hello.
- Thank you.
- Shall we? Cut! SUE VERTUE: Today we're in the middle of the City, and this is our Shad Sanderson bank.
Everyone's seen a Sherlock Holmes.
I think what's different, you've never seen Sherlock Holmes in this scenario, with escalators, with modern technology.
The whole soul of it, I think, is the same, and true to the original Sherlock Holmes stories, but it just has this modern twist.
And it's And taxis and London buses and just this huge expanse.
The more modern things around, the better it sort of works, really, for us.
Action! HOLMES: Two operatives, based in London.
Both travel to Dalian, where they smuggle those vases.
One of them helps himself to something, a little hairpin.
WATSON: Worth 9 million.
HOLMES: Eddie Van Coon was the thief.
He stole the treasure when he was in China.
WATSON: How'd you know it was Van Coon, not Lukis? Even the killer didn't know that.
HOLMES: Because of the soap.
THOMPSON: I think the original script, there's pages and pages at the beginning where I try to describe this building, and so it was great for me walking in it this morning and actually seeing the location they'd picked.
I'd not seen it before.
They told me they were coming to Tower 42, but I'd not seen it before, so when I came in this morning and saw it, and I remembered six months ago writing this very vivid, visual description as to what it was going to be like, it was great to finally see it for real and see what they'd chosen.
Yes, when you said we were going to the bank VERTUE: And really, what we're just doing is to give a real sense of London and size and things, so the last few days we've been here, and we've been Trafalgar Square WATSON: You need advice? HOLMES: On painting, yes.
I need to talk to an expert.
SUE VERTUE: It's just the scale of London that you get, from Trafalgar Square and walking up towards the gallery and everything, that you just can't get anywhere else, really.
Chinatown DIRECTOR: OK, just make sure, where B camera's set up, don't obscure our eyeline to Sarah.
We've been to Hungerford Bridge WATSON: Tuesday morning.
All you've got to do is turn up and say the bag was yours.
HOLMES: Forget about your court case.
We've been to Shaftesbury Avenue.
- Ooh, Jesus.
- Right.
- Van Coon came here - Yeah? on the day he died, with a package - whatever was hidden inside that suitcase.
Mm-hm.
I pieced together his movements using scraps of information.
- Sherlock - Credit card bills, receipts.
He came here after he got back from China.
Sherlock Somewhere in this street, somewhere near.
I don't know where Yeah, that shop, over there.
- How do you know? - Lukis's diary.
He was here.
He wrote down the address.
We wanted to show London, not just the normal locations, so there's some big, big locations that they're seeing.
[POP MUSIC PLAYS] John, I want you to go up onto the railway line and look for anything that looks like the same colour.
If we're going to decipher this language, we're going to need a lot more evidence.
It's been really interesting for me, seeing the locations.
Some very unusual ones.
I mean, one of the films is particularly about codes and ciphers, and they're painted in different places, like clues.
Very odd tunnels we went into, right on the South Bank, for example.
You realise you live in London and half the time you don't know it at all.
I was just staggered when I saw these things! The first thing we made wasn't any of these three movies.
The first thing we made was a pilot.
The name's Sherlock Holmes, and the address is 221 B Baker Street.
Afternoon.
This pilot wasn't intended as a pilot.
It was intended to be the first episode of our Sherlock Holmes television series, but it was 60 minutes long, because that was the plan.
And the BBC liked it so much they said, "Well, we want three 90s now.
" But the thing about that is you can't simply bolt on another half-hour.
What we had to do, really, was to sort of make it from scratch.
Coky Giedroyc directed the pilot, and did a fantasticjob of it But once you start pulling things apart, you really have to start again, because every scene is probably somewhere else.
John! John Watson! Stamford.
Mike Stamford.
We were at Barts together.
Yes.
Sorry, yes.
Mike, hello.
Yeah, I know.
I got fat.
John! John Watson! Stamford.
Mike Stamford.
We were at Barts together.
- Yes, sorry.
Yes, Mike, hello.
- Yeah, I know, I got fat.
One of the advantages of making a pilot is that you can make the series right.
That means you can look at a pilot, and a pilot is changeable.
You can alter it.
You can say, "Let's change that set, let's alter that location.
" You can say any of those things.
It might seem wasteful.
It truly isn't.
It's the biggest saving you can make, is to have, in effect, a test flight.
And see what this show looks like if it's actually made, as opposed to the theory.
So the shooter's not one of yours, then.
God, no, we didn't have time.
A guy like that would have had enemies, I suppose.
One of them could have been following him.
Whoever it was was gone by the time we got there and we've got nothing to go on.
Oh, I wouldn't say that.
By the time you've got a different DoP, you've got a different camera - which is a far superior camera to the one that we could afford, in fact, on the pilot - it just won't match.
[PHONE RINGS] Hello? How do you make them take the poison? What? What did you say? I said, how do you make them take the poison? - Oi! Who are you? - Sherlock Holmes.
Do you like drugs, Sherlock Holmes? - Not in a while.
- I ask because you're very resilient.
Most people would have passed out by now.
Taxi for Sherlock Holmes.
I didn't order a taxi.
Doesn't mean you don't need one.
You're the cabbie.
The one who stopped outside Northumberland Street.
It was you.
Not your passenger.
See, no-one ever thinks about the cabbie.
It's like you're invisible.
Just the back of an 'ead.
Proper advantage for a serial killer.
So even if there are a couple of scenes where we had to say to them, "You couldn't just do what you did in the pilot, could you?" Because, you know, a lot of it did work.
But it was just easier to do it, to shoot it all again, really.
You rarely get the chance to have another go.
And there are all kinds of little things that we've been able to have another look at.
Baker Street itself, the interior of Baker Street.
Well, this could be very nice.
Very nice indeed.
Yes, I think so.
The final sequence in Episode 1 which originally took place in 221 B, now doesn't.
So a lot of the scene is the same but it now takes place somewhere else.
- My flat.
- Of course it is, yeah.
Found your keys in yourjacket.
I thought, well, why not? People like to die at home.
Where are we? You know every street in London.
You know exactly where we are.
Roland-Kerr Further Education College.
Why here? It's open.
Cleaners are in.
One thing about being a cabbie, you always know a nice, quiet spot for a murder.
I'm surprised more of us don't branch out.
The one thing that really, really was significant for us, a real moment for us, was that the scenes that worked best in that pilot were where the modern world was really, really apparent, was really surrounding our characters.
So, ran after a cab.
- I told you that limp was psychosomatic.
- I knew it was.
You did get shot, though.
- Oh, yeah.
In the shoulder.
- Ah.
If you stand Benedict and Martin in the half-light, against a Victorian wall, you wouldn't know it had been updated.
We have an idea now that you really should know in every shot that this is a modern-day Sherlock Holmes, because that's where the show has the most energy and is the most exciting.
221 B Baker Street is a very, very famous address, so it's quite a thrill when you step onto that set for the first time and think, "Right, this is his home in the 21 st century.
" Well, this could be very nice.
BERYL VERTUE: It was interesting for everybody, doing the interior of 221 B Baker Street because, you know, we're not into gas lamps, as I've said to you.
This is contemporary, this is modern-day.
But at the same time, you need for the Sherlock Holmes aficionados not to just lose it totally.
And also Sherlock, be he in the olden days or contemporary, he's still that same eccentric character and he wouldn't live in something that was, you know, too suburban or too modern.
WATSON: So, this is HOLMES: Well, obviously I can straighten things up.
It was really quite a difficult thing to get 221 B exactly right.
Quite often you can go too far down the road of it being too much of a mess, and you think, "Oh, it's like every single item they've ever owned "is now stacked for you to see on every surface, that's too much.
" It has to be a flat that two young fellas believably would live in.
The moment you bring it up to date, it sort of becomes half the familiar Baker Street and half Men Behaving Badly, because that's what it is.
It is these two fellas living in a flat, putting dreadful things in the fridge.
A severed head! - Just tea for me, thanks.
- No, there's a head in the fridge.
- Yes.
- A bloody head! Where else was I supposed to put it? You don't mind, do you? We really loved the scenes that we filmed in the Baker Street studio.
I love the design of it and I love the cosiness of it.
It looks beautiful and you instantly feel like it's a place with history.
You feel like you're Because it's been so well done, it's been so well dressed, so well designed, that it's like you are going into a flat that has been there for 1 50 years.
It's really good.
GATISS: It's one of those curious things, when you're basing something on existing stories and a very familiar world to people, you do have to, sort of, create, as it were, a bible of your version.
We wanted to have things like the jackknife on the mantelpiece which transfixes unopened correspondence.
A curious thing happened on the first day of shooting.
We were dressing various things in and I spotted this picture just there, where it is now.
And in the original stories, Dr Watson has an unframed picture of a man called Henry Ward Beecher.
This is not Henry Ward Beecher, but it's a complete coincidence.
The props people had just dressed in an unframed picture.
I said, "Leave that, that's like a little accidental reference.
" Um And obviously, through there in the kitchen, which Sherlock has just completely converted into his laboratory, we've got a lot of microscope equipment and test tubes and stuff like that.
It would be no accident to open the margarine tub and find a severed finger in there.
His experiments kind of creep out into the rest of everybody's life.
And I think it's quite a funny thing, the idea that they are flatmates and they're supposed to be two units, but Sherlock's interests and obsessions spread out like a mould through the house.
Sherlock! The mess you've made! SUE VERTUE: Today, we are doing the music for Episode 1 .
So David and Michael have done a bass line for the music and then we're now adding all the strings.
[MUTED DISCUSSION] I think the first thing was just trying to come up with a central theme and a character for it.
Is there a way of playing this character that, you know, is relevant to the movie that they've made and the character they're making? So, it's discussions with Steven and Sue and Mark, and then both myself and Michael try to find common ground in terms of what is going to be the defining sound of this show.
Here we go.
Eight clicks into three.
So the clicks start on the downbeat of bar one.
Myself and David Arnold are the composers, but we both work with fabulous assistants, programmers, orchestrators, arrangers, lots of people who all work really, really hard to make sure that when we come here for the sessions, everything is done and everything is absolutely flawless.
So, with the musicians, we can Because their time is very, very precious, we can just fly through things.
[DRAMATIC CHORD BUILDS] [MUSIC PLAYS] Entry at 43, beat 3, please.
SUE VERTUE: Music itself, I think it brings the whole thing together.
You do it at the end.
It is very subjective as well, I think, but it really brings out the drama or the light touch.
You need to know it's there without being overly aware of it, unless it's the time when it's really, you know, stressful and tense, when you really do want to hear that music coming through.
I think there's a lot of that really exciting stuff in this one.
[MUSIC BUILDS] GATISS: You know what you want, I think, and sometimes, when music really delivers, it's a fantastically satisfying thing.
You feel like, if your emotions are rising at the time, that the score is taking you along that journey.
Are we doing super-well? Thank you very much for the accelerated pace, guys.
The nature of the way the music has been written for this show We have certain pre-recorded synthetic elements, but I think, once you put real musicians on something, it starts to come to life and adds a real personality.
So I'm very pro having real people playing music for whatever it is, whether it's a TV show, animation or a film.
Notes on page are fine, but I think when you get people actually putting a real performance into something, it can make so much difference tothe way the music sounds, but also the way that you perceive the programme.
[TENSE MUSIC] You hope the music speaks for itself, you hope that what you have written is clear enough for them just to play and for it to work.
But from time to time, you can, um Sometimes we'll just turn the screens around and go, "Oh, it's this bit! This is what's happening now.
" And they go, "Oh, now we get it.
Why didn't you say?" So it's a fabulous living, breathing thing.
The exciting thing about Sherlock Holmes is an awful lot of the way forward is already there in the stories, because we have really been quite faithful, in a way, to lots of the ingredients in those stories, but using them in new ways.
What would The Hound Of The Baskervilles be in a modern setting? What would The Speckled Band be in a modern setting? Looking at their stories and updating them and thinking, "What would a haunted house be?" Haunted houses are a stalwart of Sherlock Holmes, but what's a modern haunted house? How would that be now? All those incidents.
We've got stuff from the stories that's never been covered.
Watson spends quite a lot of the stories married.
Are we going to do that? We could.
We could marry off John and have him living somewhere else other than Baker Street.
That's open to us.
All those things are out there for us in the future, and, if you know your Sherlock Holmes, you'll be sort of thinking, "Oh, how are they going to handle that?" 
And mark it.
B marker.
We're just excited to be back.
Genuinely, properly, thinking, "Well, look, everybody loves it, we know that everybody loves it.
" And it's a different feeling, because the first time we did it, nobody cared or knew about us.
It was a surprise, the level of response, the positive response we got was a real wonderful surprise, and just utter confirmation that the hard work had paid off.
And, yeah, it's been a thrill.
The amount of millions of people in this country who watched it and who raved about it, and the amount of critics who raved about it, and then internationally how well it did.
This has become such an enormous international hit it's sort of preposterous.
It's our vanity project, it's our hobby, and everybody's joined in.
It's certainly changed from this series from the last series.
Last series, nobody really knew who Benedict was, he wasn't a household name.
It's a very different world this time.
You know, if we're outside 221, there's a whole row of people just standing there.
Now that I look at Benedict and Martin capering around on set, I think, "Those are famous images.
"This room that we're in, 221B Baker Street, is incredibly famous, "those two men are now so famous throughout the world in those roles.
" It's a very sudden, very big change.
It's nerve-wracking, when you're a hit, to keep the quality going, but I think you therefore try even harder and push it even further.
We're tackling the three biggest stories in the canon, well, the ones that have the most amount of resonance when people mention Sherlock Holmes.
Let's do the three big things, and the three big things are the Hound, the Woman and the Professor.
It's love, horror and thriller.
In episode one, A Scandal in Belgravia, we have to finish the swimming pool scene, obviously.
The last season ended on a cliffhanger, so nobody knew.
Hopefully what we've achieved is that you're just like, "Oh, my God," and then the story moves on quite quickly.
Say that again! I will find you and I will skin you.
What they want is to have the threat of Moriarty to remain for the rest of the series.
In A Scandal in Belgravia, which is based on A Scandal in Bohemia, he encounters the only woman in the original stories that he really pays any attention to at all.
Holmes faces one of his deadliest enemies in the shape of love, and it comes in the form of Irene Adler, who's this extraordinary dominatrix, this incredibly daring professional woman who's utterly independent, fiercely smart and very resourceful.
Oh, you're rather good.
You're not so bad.
Him meeting a sort of version of himself or someone who is his equal.
Steve immediately had this idea that she should be a dominatrix.
And so that's interesting, doing that, 'cause again you didn't want to do this clich of a dominatrix, didn't want it to be like a sort of Ann Summers party gone wrong or something.
So we tried our best to keep it classy and fun.
Well, now, have you been wicked, Your Highness? It's not very often you're standing there in next to nothing with a leather whip in your hand, having a go at Benedict Cumberbatch.
Drop it.
I said drop it! I did say at every opportunity, "Do you need me to ease off?" And he was like, "No, go for it, go for it.
" My employer has a problem.
A matter has come to light of an extremely delicate and potentially criminal nature and in this hour of need, dear brother, your name has arisen.
In the first instance, it's actually to cover up a royal scandal, it's to try and put to bed, no pun intended, some photographs which are salacious and ruining in their content.
What do you know about this woman? Irene Adler.
And I assume this Adler woman has some compromising photographs? - You're very quick, Mr Holmes.
- Hardly a difficult deduction.
Generally, Sherlock knows he's the cleverest person in the room, and so when he meets Irene, he kind of He might not be the cleverest person in the room and that's upsetting.
And they're clearly absolutely made for each other, so that's a fascinating thing to play with.
It's a negative, in his book, it's something that is basically going to undermine his ability to do his job, to concentrate and focus and apply logic.
I like detective stories.
And detectives.
Brainy is the new sexy.
Position of the car Uh, the position of the car relative to the hiker at the time of the backfire, that and the fact that the death blow was to the back of the head, that's all you need to know.
In Hound of the Baskervilles, or, as it has now become, The Hounds of Baskerville, he comes face to face with the idea of real, deranging terror.
Maybe we should just look for whoever's got a big dog.
- Henry's right.
- What? I saw it, too.
When Sherlock thinks he has seen a gigantic hound, then he's really terrified, because he knows that he can't trust the evidence of his own eyes.
He is not above that, he's not incapable of experiencing absolute terror, and he tries to rationalise it away.
But he goes out on that moor and he sees the Hound, and he's frightened.
- What? - I saw it, too, John.
- Just Just a minute.
You saw what? - A hound.
Out there in the Hollow.
A gigantic hound.
It's the most filmed, it's the one that everyone knows I think the best and therefore I felt more of an obligation to include certain things.
There are so many huge, iconic moments that people expect.
There's a dog, there's fog, there's Dartmoor, there's stuff you'd better deliver.
Even the best versions, in the end, the dog, of course, is a fake.
And I thought, "Well, I'm not doing that.
"I've got to do something different.
" Trying to work that out almost killed me.
In fact, I took to saying that Hound wasn't a hound at all, it was a bitch.
It's based around a military institution, a military base, where strange sightings are seen and memories of things that didn't quite happen 30 years ago still kind of haunt people.
There is a Hound.
There is And it's down to Sherlock to get to the bottom of what it really is.
And Sherlock, he saw it, too.
No matter what he says.
He saw it.
In the final one, in The Reichenbach Fall, it's kind of almost the moment where he becomes a hero, really.
Up until now he's been this disquieting, dangerous, maybe potentially amoral man.
This is the one where he is faced with Moriarty.
It's a brilliant, very fast-paced thriller.
It starts by Jim going into the Tower of London, attempting to steal the Crown Jewels, which was, I have to say, one of the most fun days of filming I've ever had.
There was a sort of a soundtrack of classical music in the background, which I had to sort of dance along to.
Well, I didn't have to.
I did.
Moriarty, in a way, is what comes to define Sherlock Holmes as a hero, he realises his place in the world.
Ah, Moriarty's smart.
You can't kill an idea, can you? Not once it's made a home there.
We don't think of these as episodes, we think of them as films, we think of them as movies, 'cause they're 90 minutes long and if you just do them as episodes of a TV series, they'll seem very slow and very long.
They have to have the size and weight of a movie.
You can do whatever you want in Sherlock, there's no I think we've shown the audience that you might expect to see anything.
Well, in this one, it even goes further and further.
Series 2 has still got all the on-screen text and things like that, but there's just new ways of doing things.
- It's the title.
- What does it need a title for? Yeah, we had a lot of toys in this one.
We had Phantom cameras, which are really high-speed cameras that give you that very, very slow, slow, slow, slow motion.
You can only shoot about 17 seconds I think per go, then the whole thing has to be calmed down and put in a corner and given a cup of tea and then wound up again.
And that was the sequence where I disarm Nielson and clock him on the back of the head, having opened the safe and it explodes.
Vatican cameos.
And I had to do that incredibly quickly, but it's all sort of slowed down with this John Woo effect and the heads going whoo-whoo.
And I grab hold of the gun, disarm him and clock 'em all off, all in one move.
That was great fun to do.
Sherlock Series 2, for me, as a Special Effects Supervisor, has kept me very busy.
There's a few more bangs, a few more bullet hits, a few more atmospherics, so, yeah, this year is pretty full-on.
- Are we here? - Two streets away, but this'll do.
I've had a great deal of fun doing the stunts.
You know, me and Ben know each other reasonably well now, so I feel comfortable doing stuff with him, and so, yeah, things like the fight stuff or physical stuff.
Punch me in the face.
But I had to let him punch me, that was part of the deal this time around.
Punch you? Yes, punch me in the face.
Didn't you hear me? I always hear "punch me in the face" when you're speaking, - but it's usually subtext.
- Oh, for God's sakes.
There was no way I was not going to pass up an opportunity to even nearly punch Benedict in the face.
There's no way I was going to pass that up.
However much the stunt man might have wanted to get in there, that's my gig.
Punch me in the face.
Punch you? I said punch me in the face.
Didn't you hear me? I always hear "punch me in the face" when you're speaking, - but it's usually subtext.
- Oh, for God's sakes.
Ow! Ah! Thank you.
That was It's the only way that he would get away with it otherwise.
I think we're done now, John.
You may not remember, Sherlock, I was a soldier.
I killed people.
- You were a doctor! - I had bad days! Doing the fall in Reichenbach Fall was really exciting.
That's me.
That's me up on a roof.
That's not me jumping off the roof, but it's me jumping off a smaller roof onto a lower roof, which is about four feet, and then that cuts to me on a wire, dropping 70 feet, I think, onto a massive inflated bag.
Sher Fast.
Not terminal velocity but there's a tiny brake on it, 'cause they need to slow you down before the end so obviously if they did that the last bit of it would look weird, 'cause you'd be braking like that.
So this, it's fast, fast, fast, fast, slow.
But it's pretty bloody fast.
There's a brilliant kind of montage where Sherlock starts to describe a murder investigation.
Two men, a car, nobody else.
And basically it was so that Benedict could take her along with him and they share this I guess it's a part of the love story, if you like.
And the hiker's taking a moment, looking at the sky.
Watching the birds? Any moment now, something's going to happen.
What? The hiker's going to die.
So, Steven had written the scene which goes between the house and the field and we wanted the transitions between the two, so Paul McGuigan said to Arwel, the designer, "I want bits of the room in the field.
" We just replicated the wall of the living room here and put it on the side of a road next to the car, to start with, and then in a field, to help with those transitions, and then took it away again.
Which doesn't sound too complicated, until you're talking about a house of this scale where the one wall is four metres high by six metres wide, with a fireplace in it.
We had this huge bit of wall, just wandering down the road, going into the field, and a hydraulic bed, which just worked perfectly, I think.
There's a transition from when he's actually in bed and kind of starting to come out of this dream sequence, and he's in the field and then has to actually appear in bed.
And Sherlock's getting really, really tired, and then out of nowhere appears a bed.
Paul, the director, talked about having a bed flipping up into shot.
I did exactly that and made a bed on a pneumatic piston, which means it's a piston by using air, and I press a button and it flipped the bed.
Then he picks up a sheet, then he just lies there, and it looks like he's lying down.
And in the next shot, we're in Baker Street from the exact same shot we matched, and we pull up and we see he's back in Baker Street.
That was wonderful because I did that moment and in the rehearsal people were going, "Oh, my God!" They were watching, like, ten people just getting ecstatic about it, which is quite a rare thing, to get an immediate audience response on television.
A lot of times, people will just put it down to, "Well, they've CGI'd that.
That's easy.
" Erm, yeah, I'm upstaged by a bed, an electronic bed.
I can't believe it.
One of the things that Paul wanted to bring to it was the idea that Sherlock Holmes sees the world in an extraordinary way, so in a way it's incumbent on us to visualise the world in an extraordinary way, like Sherlock Holmes is behind the camera as well.
It's one of the best examples of the camera helping to tell the story of any television I've ever seen, actually, I think, 'cause what happens in camera I think is extraordinary on this show.
You can show the scene, a dead body lying there, and then suddenly you can do it from another point of view, or several points of view, and then you can dissect that, and you dissect it in a visual way, so that you're letting your audience understand how Sherlock thinks.
Maybe two ideas.
And then we looked at how Sherlock sees things, so we use the 5 D with the stills images to go closer into things.
And then we'll shoot the same scene but we'll shoot it from a different point of view for Sherlock, so if he does walk in the room, we shoot it from his point of view.
So that the fist time you see the scene, you'd never notice that Sherlock's actually scanning the whole place or looking.
I know exactly where I'm going.
Because I didn't want him to be going, you know, having, like, Six Million Dollar Man vision or something.
So we just wanted it to feel very natural to this character, and then explain a little bit about how he does it.
And also, you know, Benedict is fantastic at just reeling off these incredible words that Steven and Mark have given him.
- Can I have a box of matches? - I'm sorry? Or your cigarette lighter, either will do.
- I don't smoke.
- No, I know you don't, but your employer does.
The deductions are They're fantastic, they're sort of show-stoppy pieces.
They are hell to do because you However well you learn them, you have to deliver them faster than you can think.
- How? - The same way that I know the victim was an excellent sportsman, recently returned from foreign travel and that the photographs I'm looking for are in this room.
Everything just comes out as one linear thought and it's a stream of consciousness, almost.
Hmm.
It's very, very, very hard to deliver, and your mind knows the minute it's used a wrong preposition or an incorrect pronoun or an utterly wrong name, which has happened on a couple of occasions.
Heaviest oil deposit is always on the first key used, that's quite clearly a three, but after that the sequence is almost impossible to read.
I'd say from the make that it's a six-digit code.
Can't be your birthday, no disrespect, but clearly you were born in the '80s.
There's a huge deduction Sherlock has by the fireside, and I just put brackets, "Sorry, Benedict.
" Because, you know, they're monstrous.
You want me to prove it, yes? We've done some scenes on this episode where I just point the camera at Benedict and I say, "OK, there's no pressure, "but this six-page monologue, I want you to do it without any cuts.
" We're looking for a dog, yes? A great big dog.
That's your brilliant theory.
Cherchez le chien! Good.
Excellent.
Yes! Where shall we start? How about them? He thinks and talks in those moments faster than I can talk at my fastest talking moments, which is quite fast.
Look at the jumper he's wearing, hardly worn.
Clearly he's uncomfortable in it.
Maybe it's because of the material, more likely the hideous pattern.
Suggests it's a present.
Probably Christmas.
Partly because we've committed this huge heresy of updating it, we sort of want to say to everyone who knows the originals, "Look, everything else is incredibly authentic.
" In fact, you'll never see a more obsessively authentic version of Sherlock Holmes than this one because it is being motored by a couple of geeks.
There's lots and lots of nods in there that Steven and Mark wanted, and they just get so excited when they walk around the set and they see all these things.
"Oh, look, there's so-and-so, so-and-so.
" And it's like kids with toys, it's lovely.
Have you got the bartitsu? Erm, yes, now, you really stitched me up on that one.
Well, Conan Doyle made it up.
When you meet people like Steven and Mark, who kind of know it probably better than they know their own family, that's a whole other level of knowledge about a writer and their work.
This is a man who can straighten a bent poker.
The scale of the stories means that we are We've got to the death of Sherlock Holmes within six episodes, they're big stories, and the big themes of love and fear and death.
We want to see them going through the fire together.
Let me come through, please.
No, he's my friend.
And that doesn't mean that by the end of this they've reached the end of their possibilities.
These are still the formative years of Sherlock Holmes.
The most important thing about this series is not that it's updated, it's the fact that those two men are still young and they're still at the beginning of what they don't yet know is going to be a lifelong partnership.
- 'Who are you? - Jim Moriarty.
'Bye! 'Consulting criminal.
'I have loved this, this little game of ours.
- 'People have died.
- That's what people DO!' ' I will stop you.
' If you don't stop prying I'll burn you.
I will burn the heart out of you.
Catch you later.
No, you won't! Sorry, boys! I'm SO changeable! It is a weakness with me, but to be fair to myself, it is my only weakness.
You can't be allowed to continue.
You just can't.
I would try to convince you, but everything I have to say has already crossed your mind.
Probably my answer has crossed yours.
Do you mind if I get that? No, please.
You've got the rest of your life.
Hello? Yes, of course it is.
What do you want? SAY THAT AGAIN! Say that again, and know that if you're lying to me, I will find you, and I will skin you.
Wait.
Sorry Wrong day to die.
Did you get a better offer? You'll be hearing from me, Sherlock.
So if you have what you say you have, I will make you rich.
If you don't, I'll make you into shoes.
What happened there? Someone changed his mind.
The question is who? Well, now, have you been wicked, Your Highness? What are you typing? Blog.
About? Us.
You mean me.
Why? Well, you're typing a lot.
Right, then.
So, what have we got? My wife seems to be spending a very long time at the office.
Boring.
I think my husband might be having an affair.
Yes.
She's not my real aunt, she's been replaced.
I know she has.
I know human ash.
Leave.
We are prepared to offer any sum of money you care to mention for the recovery of these files.
Boring.
We have this website, it explains the true meaning of comic books, cos people miss a lot of the themes.
But then all the comic books started coming true.
Interesting.
Geek Interpreter, what's that? That's the title.
What does it need a title for? Do people actually read your blog? Where do you think our clients come from? I have a website.
In which you enumerate 240 different types of tobacco ash.
Nobody's reading your website.
Right then, dyed blonde hair, no obvious cause of death, except for these speckles, whatever they are.
For God's sakes! What? The Speckled Blonde?! They wouldn't let us see Granddad when he was dead.
Is that cos he'd gone to heaven? People don't really go to heaven when they die, they're taken to a special room and burned.
Sherlock There was a plane crash in Dusseldorf yesterday.
Everyone dead.
Suspected terrorist bomb.
We do watch the news.
You said "boring" and turned over.
Well, according to the flight details, this man was checked in on board.
Inside his coat he's got a stub from his boarding pass, napkins from the flight, even one of those special biscuits.
Here's his passport, stamped at Berlin Airport.
So this man should have died in a plane crash in Germany yesterday, but instead he's in a car boot in Southwark.
Lucky escape.
Any ideas? Eight so far.
OK, four ideas.
Maybe two ideas.
No, no, no, don't mention the unsolved ones.
People want to know you're human.
Why? Because they're interested.
No, they're not.
Why are they? look at that.
1,895.
Sorry, what? I reset that counter last night.
This blog has had nearly 2,000 hits in the last eight hours.
This is your living, Sherlock, not 240 different types of tobacco ash.
So what's this one? Belly Button Murders? The Navel Treatment? There's a lot of press outside, guys.
Well, they won't be interested in us.
Yeah, that was before you were an internet phenomenon.
A couple of them specifically wanted photographs of you two.
God's sake! John? Cover your face and walk fast.
Still, it's good for the public image, big case like this.
I'm a private detective, the last thing I need is a public image.
Hello.
I think it's time, don't you? Dear! Thumbs!? The door was The door was Boys! You've got another one! Tell us from the start, DON'T be boring.
Hey! Are you OK? Excuse me! Are you all right? Sir, phone call for you.
Carter.
'Have you heard of Sherlock Holmes?' Who? Well, you're about to meet him now.
This is your case, it's entirely up to you, this is just '.
.
friendly advice, but give Sherlock five minutes on your crime scene, 'and listen to everything that he has to say.
And as far as possible ' try not to punch him.
OK.
Sir, this gentleman says he needs to speak to you Yes, I know.
Sherlock Holmes.
John Watson.
Are you set up for wi-fi? 'You realise this is a tiny bit humiliating?' It's OK, I'm fine.
Now show me to the stream.
'I didn't really mean for you.
' Look, this is a six.
There's no point in my leaving the flat for anything less than a seven, we agreed.
Now go back, show me the grass.
When did we agree that? We agreed it yesterday.
Stop! 'Closer.
' I wasn't even at home yesterday.
I was in Dublin.
It's hardly my fault you weren't listening.
Shut up! 'Do you just carry on talking when I'm away? ' I don't know, how often are you away? 'Now '.
.
show me the car that backfired.
It's there.
'That's the one that made the noise, yes?' Yeah.
If you're thinking gunshot '.
.
there wasn't one.
'He wasn't shot, 'he was killed by a single blow to the back from a blunt instrument, 'which then magically disappeared, along with the killer.
' It's got to be an eight, at least.
You've got two more minutes, they want to know more about the driver.
Forget him, he's an idiot.
Why else would he think himself a suspect? I think he's a suspect.
'Pass me over.
' All right, but there's a mute button, and I will use it.
Up a bit! I'm not talking from down here! OK.
Just take it, take it.
'Having successfully committed a crime without a single witness ' why would he call the police and consult a detective? Fair play? He's trying to be clever.
It's overconfidence.
Did you see him? Morbidly obese, the undisguised halitosis of a single man living on his own.
The right sleeve of an internet porn addict, the breathing pattern of an untreated heart condition.
Low self-esteem, tiny IQ and a limited life expectancy, and you think he's a criminal mastermind?! Don't worry, this is just stupid.
What did you say? Heart what? Go to the stream.
What's in the stream? Go and see.
Sherlock! You weren't answering your doorbell.
His room's through the back, get him some clothes.
Who the hell are you? Sorry, Mr Holmes 'Sherlock, what's going on? ' You're coming with us.
'What's happening?' I've lost him.
I don't know what Dr Watson? Yeah.
It's for you.
OK, thanks.
No, sir, the helicopter.
Please, Mr Holmes, where you're going you'll want to be dressed.
I know exactly where I'm going.
You wearing any pants? No.
OK.
At Buckingham Palace.
Right.
Ha, ha.
Aah, aah, I am seriously fighting an impulse to steal an ashtray.
What are we doing here, Sherlock, seriously, what? I don't know.
Here to see the Queen? Apparently, yes.
Just once, can you two behave like grown-ups? We solve crimes, I blog about it, and he forgets his pants.
I wouldn't hold out too much hope.
I was in the middle of a case, Mycroft.
What, the hiker and the backfire? I glanced at the police report, a bit obvious, surely? Transparent.
Time to move on then.
We are in Buckingham Palace, the very heart of the British nation.
Sherlock Holmes, put your trousers on! What for? Your client.
And my client is? Illustrious, in the extreme.
And remaining, I have to inform you, entirely anonymous.
Mycroft.
Harry.
May I just apologise for the state of my little brother.
A full-time occupation, I imagine.
And this must be Dr John Watson, formerly of the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers? Hello, yes.
My employer is a tremendous fan of your blog.
Your employer? Particularly enjoyed the one about the aluminium crutch.
Thank you And Mr Holmes the Younger.
You look taller in your photographs.
I take the precaution of a good coat and a short friend.
Mycroft, I don't do anonymous clients.
I'm used to mystery at one end of my cases, both ends is too much work.
Good morning.
This is a matter of national importance.
Grow up! Get off my sheet! Or what? Or I'll just walk away.
I'll let you.
Boys, please Not here.
Who is my client? Take a look at where you're standing, and make a deduction.
You are to be engaged by the highest in the land, now, for God's sake! Put your clothes on! I'll be mother.
And there is a whole childhood in a nutshell.
My employer has a problem.
A matter has come to light of an extremely delicate and potentially criminal nature, and in this hour of need, dear brother, your name has arisen.
Why? We have a police force of sorts, even a marginally secret service.
Why come to me? People come to you for help, don't they, Mr Holmes? Not to date anyone with a navy.
This is a matter of the highest security, and therefore of trust.
You don't trust your own secret service? Naturally not.
They all spy on people for money.
I do think we have a timetable.
Yes, of course What do you know about this woman? Nothing whatsoever.
Then you should be paying more attention.
She's been at the centre of two political scandals in the last year, and recently ended the marriage of a prominent novelist by having an affair with both participants separately.
You know I don't concern myself with trivia.
Who is she? Irene Adler.
Professionally known as "The Woman".
Professionally? There are many names for what she does.
She prefers "dominatrix".
Dominatrix.
Don't be alarmed.
It's to do with sex.
Sex doesn't alarm me.
How would you know? She provides, shall we say, recreational scolding for those who enjoy that sort of thing and are prepared to pay for it.
These are all from her website.
And I assume this Adler woman has some compromising photographs.
You're very quick, Mr Holmes.
Hardly a difficult deduction.
Photographs of whom? A person of significance to my employer.
We'd prefer not to say any more at this time.
You can't tell us anything? I can tell you it's a young person.
A young female person.
How many photographs? A considerable number, apparently.
Do Miss Adler and this young female person appear in these photographs together? Yes.
I assume in a number of compromising scenarios? An imaginative range, we are assured.
John, you might want to put that cup back in your saucer now.
Can you help us, Mr Holmes? How? Will you take the case? What case? Pay her, now and in full.
As Miss Adler remarks in her masthead, know when you are beaten.
She doesn't want anything.
She got in touch.
She informed us that the photographs existed.
She indicated that she had no intention to use them to extort either money or favour.
A power play.
A power play with the most powerful family in Britain.
Now that is a dominatrix.
This is getting rather fun, isn't it.
Sherlock Where is she? In London, currently.
She's staying Text me the details, I'll be in touch by the end of the day.
Do you really think you'll have news by then? No, I think I'll have the photographs.
One can only hope you're as good as you seem to think.
I'll need some equipment, of course.
Anything you require, I'll have it sent Can I have a box of matches? I'm sorry? Or your cigarette lighter, either will do.
I don't smoke.
No, I know you don't, but your employer does.
We have kept a lot of people successfully in the dark about this little fact, Mr Holmes.
I'm not the Commonwealth.
And that's as modest as he gets.
Pleasure to meet you.
Laters! OK, the smoking, how did you know? The evidence was right under your nose, John, as ever you see, but do not observe.
Observe what? The ashtray.
Kate? We're going to have a visitor.
I'll need a bit of time to get ready.
A long time? .
.
Ages.
What are you doing? I'm going to into battle, John.
I need the right armour.
No.
Nah.
Works for me.
Everything works on you.
So, what's the plan? We know her address.
We just ring her doorbell? Exactly.
Just here, please.
You didn't even change your clothes.
Then it's time to add a splash of colour.
Are we here? Two streets away, but this will do.
For what? Punch me in the face.
Shade? Blood.
Punch you? Yes, punch me, in the face.
Didn't you hear me? I always hear "punch me" when you speak but it's usually sub-text.
For God's sakes! Thank you, that was OK, I think we're done now, John! You want to remember, Sherlock, I was a soldier.
I killed people.
You were a doctor! I had bad days! What are you going to wear? My battle dress.
Lucky boy.
Hello? Very sorry to disturb you, um, I've just been attacked, um, um, and I think they, they took my wallet and, um, and my phone.
Please could you help me? I can phone the police, if you want? Thank you.
Could you, please? Would you mind if I just waited here, just until they come? Thank you, thank you so much.
Thank you.
I saw it all happen.
It's OK, I'm a doctor.
Have you got a first aid kit? In the kitchen.
Please.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Hello, sorry to hear you've been hurt.
I don't think Kate caught your name? I'm so sorry, I'm It's always hard to remember an alias when you've had a fright.
Isn't it? Well, there now.
We're both defrocked Mr Sherlock Holmes.
Miss Adler, I presume.
Look at those cheekbones.
I could cut myself slapping that face.
Would you like me to try? Right, this should do it.
I've missed something, haven't I? Please, sit down.
Or if you'd like some tea, I can call the maid.
I had some at the Palace.
I know.
Clearly.
I had a tea too, at the Palace.
If anyone's interested.
Do you know the big problem with a disguise, Mr Holmes? However hard you try, it's always a self-portrait.
You think I'm a vicar with a bleeding face? No, I think you're damaged, delusional and believe in a higher power.
In your case, it's yourself.
And somebody loves you.
If I had to punch that face, I'd avoid your nose and teeth, too.
Could you put something on, please? Anything at all.
A napkin? Why? Are you feeling exposed? I don't think John knows where to look.
No, I think he knows exactly where.
I'm not sure about you.
If I was to look at naked women, I'd borrow John's laptop.
You do borrow my laptop.
I confiscate it.
Never mind, we've got better things to talk about.
Now, tell me, I need to know how was it done? What? The hiker with the bashed-in head how was he killed? That's not why I'm here.
You're here for the photographs, but that's never going to happen and as we're chatting That story's not out.
How do you know about it? I know one of the policemen.
Well, I know what he likes.
And you like policemen? I like detective stories.
And detectives.
Brainy is the new sexy.
The position of the car relative to the hiker, that and the fact that the death blow was to the back of the head, that's all you need to know.
OK, tell me, how was he murdered? He wasn't.
You don't think it was murder? I know it wasn't.
How? The same way I know the victim was a sportsman, recently returned from foreign travel and that the photographs I'm looking for are in this room.
OK, but how? So they are in this room.
Thank you.
John, man the door, let no-one in.
Two men alone in the countryside, several yards apart and one car.
I, I thought you were looking for the photos now.
No, no.
Looking takes ages, I'm just going to find them, but you're clever and we've got a moment, so let's pass the time.
Two men, a car, nobody else.
Driver's trying to fix his engine.
Getting nowhere.
And the hiker is taking a moment, looking at the sky.
Watching the birds? Any moment now, something is going to happen.
What? The hiker is going to die.
No, that's the result.
What's going to happen? I don't understand.
Well try to.
Why? Because you cater to the whims of the pathetic and take your clothes off to make an impression.
Stop boring me and think.
It's the new sexy.
The car's going to backfire.
There's going to be a loud noise.
So what? Noises are important.
They can tell you everything.
For instance Thank you.
On hearing a smoke alarm, a mother would look towards her child.
Amazing how fire exposes our priorities.
I really hope you don't have a baby in here.
All right, John, you can turn it off now.
I said you can turn it off now! Give me a minute! Thank you.
You should always use gloves with these things, you know.
Heaviest oil deposit is always on the first key used, that's a 3, but after that, the sequence is impossible to read.
I see it's a six digit code.
It can't be your birthday, no disrespect, but you were born in the '80s and 8's barely used, so I'd tell you the code right now, but you know what? I already have.
Think.
Hands behind your head, on the floor, keep it still! Sorry, Sherlock.
Miss Adler, on the floor! Don't you want me on the floor, too? No, sir, I want you to open the safe.
American.
Interesting.
Why would you care? Sir, the safe, now, please.
I don't know the code.
We've been listening, she said she told you.
If you've been listening, you'll know she didn't.
I assume I missed something.
From your reputation, I assume you didn't, Mr Holmes.
She's the one who knows the code, ask her! Yes, sir, she also knows the code that calls the police and sets off the burglar alarm.
I've learned not to trust her.
Mr Holmes doesn't Shut up! One more word out of you, just one and I will decorate that wall with the insides of your head.
That, for me, will not be a hardship.
Mr Archer, at the count of three, shoot Dr Watson.
What? I don't know the code.
One.
I don't know the code.
Two.
She didn't tell me, I don't know it! I'm prepared to believe you, any second now.
Three! No, stop! Thank you, Mr Holmes.
Open it, please.
Vatican cameos! Do you mind? Not at all.
He's dead.
Thank you.
You were very observant.
Observant? I'm flattered.
Don't be.
Flattered? There'll be more of them, they'll be keeping an eye on the building.
We should call the police.
Yes.
On their way.
For God's sake! Shut up, it's quick.
Check the rest of the house, see how they got in.
Well, that's the knighthood in the bag.
And that's mine.
All the photographs are on here, I presume? I have copies, of course.
No, you don't.
You'll have permanently disabled any kind of uplink or connection.
Unless the contents of this phone are unique, you couldn't sell them.
Who said I'm selling? Well, why would they be interested? Whatever's on the phone, it's clearly not just photographs.
That camera-phone is my life, Mr Holmes.
I'd die before I let you take it.
It's my protection.
Sherlock! It was.
Must have come in this way.
Clearly.
It's all right, she's just out cold.
God knows she's used to that.
There's a back door.
Better check it, Dr Watson.
Sure.
You're very calm.
Well, your booby trap did just kill a man.
He would have killed me.
It was self defence in advance.
What is that?! What? Give it to me.
Now.
Give it to me.
No.
Give it to me.
No.
For goodness sake! Drop it.
I said drop it! Thank you, dear.
Now, tell that sweet little posh thing the pictures are safe with me.
They're not for blackmail, just for insurance.
Besides, I might want to see her again.
No no no no no.
It's been a pleasure.
Don't spoil it.
This is how I want you to remember me, the woman who beat you.
Goodnight, Mr Sherlock Holmes.
Jesus! What are you doing? He'll sleep for a few hours.
Make sure he doesn't choke on his own vomit, it makes for a very unattractive corpse.
What's this? What have you given him? Sherlock? He'll be fine.
I've used it on loads of my friends.
Sherlock, can you hear me? You know, I was wrong about him.
He did know where to look.
For what? What are you talking about? The key-code to my safe.
What was it? Shall I tell him? My measurements.
Got it! Ssh ssh no, don't get up, I'll do the talking.
So, the car's about to backfire and the hiker, he's staring at the sky.
You said he could be watching birds, but he wasn't, was he? He was watching another kind of flying thing.
The car backfires and the hiker turns to look which was his big mistake.
By the time the driver looks up, the hiker is already dead.
He doesn't see what killed him because it's already being washed downstream.
An accomplished sportsman recently returned from foreign travel with a boomerang.
You got that from one look? Definitely the new sexy.
I I Hush, now.
It's OK.
I'm only returning your coat.
John? John! You OK? How did I get here? I don't suppose you remember much, you weren't making a lot of sense.
I should warn you, I think Lestrade filmed you on his phone.
Where is she? Where's who? The woman, that woman.
What woman? The Woman! The Woman, woman! Irene Adler? She got away, no-one saw her.
She wasn't here, Sherlock.
What are you? What? No, no, no.
No.
Back to bed.
You'll be fine in the morning.
Just sleep.
Of course I'll be fine, I am fine.
I'm absolutely fine.
Yes, you're great.
Now, I'll be next door if you need me.
Why would I need you? No reason at all.
The photographs are perfectly safe.
In the hands of a fugitive sex worker? She's not interested in blackmail.
She wants protection, for some reason.
I take it you've stood down the police investigation into the shooting at her house? How can we do anything while she has the photographs? Our hands are tied.
She'd applaud your choice of words.
You see how this works? The camera-phone is her get out of jail free card.
You have to leave her alone.
Treat her like royalty, Mycroft.
Though not the way she treats royalty.
What was that? Text.
But what was that noise? Did you know there were other people after her too before you sent John and I in there? CIA trained killers, I think.
Thanks for that.
It's a disgrace, sending your little brother into danger like that.
Family is all we have in the end, Mycroft Holmes! Shut up, Mrs Hudson! Mycroft!! Apologies.
Thank you.
Though do in fact shut up.
It's a bit rude, that noise, isn't it? There's nothing you can do and nothing she will do, as far as I can see.
I can put maximum surveillance on her.
Why bother? You can follow her on Twitter.
I believe her user name is @TheWhipHand.
Most amusing.
Excuse me.
Hello? Why does your phone make that noise? What noise? That noise, the one it just made.
It's a text alert, means I've got a text.
Your texts don't usually make that noise.
Well, somebody got hold of the phone and apparently as a joke, personalised their text alert noise.
So every time they text you It would seem so.
Could you turn that phone down a bit? At my time of life it's See I'm wondering who could have got hold of your phone.
It would've been in your coat.
I'll leave you to your deductions.
I'm not stupid, you know.
Where do you get that idea? Bond Air is go, that's decided.
Check with the Coventry lot.
Talk later.
What else does she have? Irene Adler.
The Americans wouldn't be interested in her for a couple of compromising photographs.
There's more.
Much more.
Something big's coming, isn't it? Irene Adler is no longer any concern of yours.
From now on, you will stay out of this.
Will I? Yes, Sherlock.
You will.
Now if you'll excuse me, I have a long and arduous apology to make to a very old friend.
Do give her my love.
Lovely, Sherlock.
That was lovely.
Marvellous.
Yes, very good.
I wish you could have worn the antlers.
Some things are best left to the imagination, Mrs Hudson.
Mrs H? No thank you, Sarah.
No, no, he's not good with names.
No, I can get this.
Sarah was the doctor, then there was the one with the spots, then the one with the nose and then, who was after the boring teacher? Nobody.
Jeanette! Process of elimination.
Dear Lord.
Hello, everyone.
It said on the door to come up.
Hello, Molly.
Hello, Molly! Everybody saying hello to each other, how wonderful! Let me, er Holy Mary! So we're having Christmas drinkies? No stopping them, apparently.
It's the one day of the year where the boys have to be nice to me, so it's almost worth it.
John? The counter on your blog still says 1895.
No, Christmas is cancelled And you've got a photograph of me wearing that hat! People like it.
No, they don't.
What people? How's the hip? It's atrocious, but thanks for asking.
I've seen much worse, but then I do post-mortems.
God, sorry.
Don't make jokes, Molly.
No, sorry.
Here you are.
Thank you.
I wasn't expecting to see you.
I thought you were in Dorset for Christmas? First thing in the morning, me and the wife, back together, sorted.
No, she's sleeping with a PE teacher.
And John, I hear you're off to your sister's? Yeah.
Sherlock was complaining.
Saying.
First time ever, she's cleaned up her act, off the booze.
Nope.
Shut up, Sherlock! I see you've got a new boyfriend, Molly.
You're serious about him.
Sorry, what? You're seeing him tonight, giving him a gift.
Take a day off.
Shut up.
Have a drink.
Surely you see the perfectly wrapped present in the bag.
The others are slapdash.
It's for someone special.
The shade of red echoes her lipstick an unconscious association, or one she's deliberately trying to encourage.
Either way, Miss Hooper has love on her mind.
That she's serious about him is clear from the fact she's giving him a gift.
It suggests long-term hopes.
That she's seeing him tonight is evident from her make-up and clothes.
Obviously trying to compensate for the size of her mouth and breasts.
You always say such horrible things.
Every time.
Always.
Always.
I am sorry.
Forgive me.
Merry Christmas, Molly Hooper.
No! That wasn't, I didn't No, it was me.
My God, really? What? My phone.
Fifty seven? Sorry, what? Fifty seven of those texts, the ones I've heard.
Thrilling that you've been counting.
Excuse me.
What's up, Sherlock? I said excuse me.
Do you ever reply? Dear Lord, we're not going to have Christmas phone calls now, are we? Have they passed a new law? I think you're going to find Irene Adler tonight.
We already know where she is.
As you were kind enough to point out, it hardly matters.
No, I mean you're going to find her dead.
You OK? Yes.
The only one who fitted the description.
Had her brought here, your home from home.
You didn't need to come in, Molly.
It's OK, everyone else is busy with Christmas.
The face is a bit sort of bashed-up, so it might be a bit difficult.
That's her, isn't it? Show me the rest of her.
That's her.
Thank you, Miss Hooper.
Who is she? How did Sherlock recognise her from not her face? Just the one.
Why? Merry Christmas.
Smoking indoors, isn't there one of those one of those law things? We're in a morgue.
There's only so much damage you can do.
How did you know she was dead? She had an item in her possession, one she said her life depended on.
She chose to give it up.
Where is this item now? Look at them.
They all care so much.
Do you ever wonder if there's something wrong with us? All lives end, all hearts are broken.
Caring is not an advantage, Sherlock.
This is low tar.
Well, you barely knew her.
Merry Christmas, Mycroft.
And a happy new year.
He's on his way.
Have you found anything? No.
Did he take the cigarette? Yes.
Shit! He's coming, ten minutes.
There's nothing in the bedroom.
It looks like he's clean, we've tried all the usual places.
Are you sure tonight's a danger night? No, but then I never am.
You have to stay with him, John.
I've got plans.
No.
Mycroft? I am really sorry.
You know my friends are so wrong about you? You're a great boyfriend.
OK, that's good.
I always thought I was great.
Sherlock Holmes is a very lucky man.
Jeanette, please.
No, I mean it.
It's heart-warming.
You'll do anything for him.
And he can't even tell your girlfriends apart! I'll do anything for you, just tell me what it is I'm not doing.
Don't make me compete with Sherlock Holmes! I'll walk your dog.
There, I've said it, I'll even walk your dog.
I don't have a dog! No, because that was the last one.
OK.
Jesus! I'll call you.
No! OK.
That really wasn't very good, was it? Hi.
You OK? I hope you didn't mess up my sock index this time! Lovely tune, Sherlock, haven't heard that one before.
Composing? Helps me to think.
What are you thinking about? The count on your blog is still stuck at 1895.
Yes.
Faulty, can't seem to fix it.
Faulty, or you've been hacked and it's a message.
Just faulty.
Right.
Right.
Well, I'm going out for a bit.
Listen, has he ever had any kind of girlfriend, boyfriend, a relationship, ever? I don't know.
How can we not know? He's Sherlock.
How will we ever know what goes on in that funny old head? Right.
See you.
John? Yeah? Hello? Hello.
So, any plans for new year tonight? Nothing fixed.
Nothing I couldn't heartlessly abandon.
You have any ideas? One.
You know, Mycroft could just phone me, if he didn't have this bloody stupid power complex.
Couldn't we just go to a cafe? Sherlock doesn't follow me everywhere.
Through there.
He's on his way.
You were right, he thinks it's Mycroft.
He's writing sad music.
Doesn't eat, barely talks, only to correct the television.
I'd say he was heart-broken, but, well he's Sherlock.
He does all that anyway.
Hello, Dr Watson.
Tell him you're alive.
He'd come after me.
I'll come after you if you don't.
I believe you.
You were dead on a slab.
It was definitely you.
DNA tests are only as good as the records you keep.
And I bet you know the record keeper.
I know what he likes.
And I needed to disappear.
Then how come I can see you and I don't even want to? Look, I made a mistake, I sent something to Sherlock for safekeeping, now I need it back.
I need your help.
No.
It's for his own safety.
So is this.
Tell him you're alive.
I can't.
Fine, I'll tell him and I still won't help you.
What do I say? What do you normally say?! You've texted him a lot! Just the usual stuff.
There is no usual in this case.
"Good morning.
I like your funny hat.
"I'm sad tonight, let's have dinner.
" You look sexy on Crimewatch, let's have dinner.
"I'm not hungry.
"Let's have dinner".
You flirted with Sherlock Holmes? At him.
He never replies.
No, Sherlock always replies to everything.
He's Mr Punchline.
He will outlive God trying to have the last word.
Does that make me special? I don't know, maybe.
Are you jealous? We're not a couple.
Yes, you are.
There, "I'm not dead.
" "Let's have dinner".
Who the hell knows about Sherlock Holmes? But for the record, if anyone out there still cares, I'm not actually gay.
Well, I am.
Look at us both.
I don't think so, do you? Stop it! Stop it! Sherlock! Sherlock, Sherlock Don't snivel, Mrs Hudson, it'll do nothing to impede the flight of a bullet.
What a tender world that would be.
Please, Sherlock I believe that you have something that we want, Mr Holmes.
Then why don't you ask for it? I've been asking this one, she doesn't seem to know anything.
But you know what I'm asking for, don't you, Mr Holmes? I believe I do.
Please, help.
First get rid of your boys.
Why? I dislike being outnumbered, it makes for too much stupid in the room.
You two, go to the car.
Then get into the car and drive away.
Don't try to trick me, you know who I am, it doesn't work.
Next, you can stop pointing that gun at me.
So you can point a gun at me? I'm unarmed.
Mind if I check? I insist.
Moron.
Thank you.
You're all right now, you're all right.
Jeez, what the hell is happening? Mrs Hudson has been attacked by an American, I'm restoring balance to the universe.
Mrs Hudson, my God, are you all right? Jesus, what have they done to you? I'm just being so silly.
Take her downstairs and look after her.
It's all right, I'll have a look at that.
I'm fine, I'm fine.
Are you going to tell me what's going on? I expect so, now go.
Lestrade? We've had a break-in at Baker Street.
Send your least irritating officers and an ambulance.
No, no, no, we're fine.
No, it's the burglar, he's got himself rather badly injured.
A few broken ribs, fractured skull, suspected punctured lung He fell out of a window.
It stings.
That was right on my bins.
And exactly how many times did he fall out the window? It's all a bit of a blur, Detective Inspector.
I lost count.
She'll have to sleep upstairs in our flat tonight, we need to look after her.
No She's fine.
No, she's not, look at her.
She's got to take some time away from Baker Street.
She can stay with her sister, doctor's orders.
Don't be absurd.
She's in shock, for God's sake, and all over some stupid camera-phone where is it anyway? Safest place I know.
You left it in the pocket of your second best dressing gown, you clot! I managed to sneak it out when they thought I was having a cry.
Thank you.
Shame on you, John Watson.
Shame on me? Mrs Hudson leave Baker Street? England would fall.
Where is it now? Where no-one will look.
Whatever's on that phone is more than just pictures.
Yes, it is.
So, she's alive then.
How are we feeling about that? Happy New Year, John.
Do you think you'll be seeing her again? Is that a phone? It's a camera-phone.
And you're x-raying it? Yes, I am.
Whose phone is it? A woman's.
Your girlfriend? She's my girlfriend because I'm x-raying her possessions? Well, we all do silly things! Yes they do, don't they? Very silly.
She sent this to my address.
She loves to play games.
She does? Hey, Sherlock We have a client.
What, in your bedroom? So, who's after you? People who want to kill me.
Who's that? Killers.
It would help if you were a tiny bit more specific.
So you faked your own death to get ahead of them? It worked for a while.
Except you let John know you're alive, therefore me.
I knew you'd keep my secret.
You couldn't.
But you did, didn't you? Where's my camera-phone? It's not here.
We're not stupid.
What have you done with it? If they've guessed, they'll be watching you.
Then they'll know I took a safety deposit box at a bank on the Strand a few months ago.
I need it.
Well, we can't just go and get it, can we? Molly Hooper, she could collect it, take it to Barts.
Then one of your homeless network could bring it here, leave it in the cafe, one of the boys downstairs could bring it up the back.
Very good, John, excellent plan, full of intelligent precautions.
Thank you.
So, why don't I phone So, what do you keep on here? In general, I mean? Pictures, information, anything I might find useful.
For blackmail? For protection.
I make my way in the world, I misbehave.
I like to know people will be on my side exactly when I need them to be.
So how do you acquire this information? I told you I misbehave.
But you've acquired something more danger than protection.
Do you know what it is? Yes but I don't understand it.
I assumed.
Show me.
The passcode.
It's not working.
No, because it's a duplicate I had made into which you just entered the numbers 1058.
I assumed you'd choose something more specific than that, but thanks, anyway.
I told you that camera-phone was my life.
I know when it's in my hand.
You're rather good.
You're not so bad.
Hamish.
John Hamish Watson, just if you were looking for baby names.
There was a man, an MOD official and I knew what he liked.
One of the things he liked was showing off.
He told me this email was going to save the world.
He didn't know but I photographed it he was a bit tied up at the time.
It's a bit small on that screen, can you read it? Yes.
Code, obviously.
I had one of the country's best cryptographers take a look, though he was mostly upside down, as I recall.
Couldn't figure it out.
What can you do, Mr Holmes? Go on, impress a girl.
There's a margin for error, but I'm pretty sure there's a 747 leaving Heathrow tomorrow at 6.
30 for Baltimore.
Apparently it's going to save the world, I'm not sure how, but give me a moment, I've only been on the case eight seconds.
Come on, it's not code, these are seats on a jet.
Look, no 'I' because it can be mistaken for one.
No letters past 'K' the width of the plane is the limit.
The numbers always appear not in sequence, but the letters have little runs of sequence families and couples sitting together.
Only a Jumbo's wide enough for a letter 'K' or rows past 55, so there's always an upstairs.
A row 13 eliminates superstitious airlines.
The style of the flight number, '007', eliminates a few more.
Assuming a British point of origin because of the original source, and assuming the crisis is imminent, the only flight that matches all the criteria and departs within the week is the 6.
30 to Baltimore tomorrow from Heathrow.
Please don't feel obliged to tell me that was amazing, John's expressed that in every possible variant available in English.
I would have you right here, on this desk, until you begged for mercy twice.
John, can you check those flight schedules, see if I'm right? I'm on it, yeah.
I've never begged for mercy in my life.
Twice.
Yeah, you're right, flight double 'o' seven.
What did you say? You're right.
No, what did you say after that? Double 'o' seven, flight double 'o' seven.
Double 'o' seven, double 'o' seven Something, double 'o' seven What? Double 'o' seven, double 'o' seven, what? What, something, what?! Bond Air is go.
Bond Air is go.
Bond Air is go.
'Bond Air is go, that's decided.
'Check with the Coventry lot.
' Coventry.
I've never been.
Is it nice? Where's John? He went out, a couple of hours ago.
I was just talking to him.
He said you do that.
What's Coventry got to do with anything? It's a story, probably not true in the Second World War, the Allies knew Coventry was going to get bombed, because they'd broken the German code, but didn't want the Germans to know that, so they let it happen anyway.
Have you ever had anyone? I'm sorry? And when I say had, I'm being indelicate.
I don't understand.
I'll be delicate then.
Let's have dinner.
Why? You might be hungry.
I'm not.
Good.
Why would I want to have dinner if I wasn't hungry? Mr Holmes, if it was the end of the world, if this was the very last night would you have dinner with me? Sherlock? Too late.
That's not the end of the world, that's Mrs Hudson.
Sherlock, this man was at the door, is the bell still not working? He shot it.
Have you come to take me away again? Yes, Mr Holmes.
Well, I decline.
I don't think you do.
There's going to be a bomb on a passenger jet.
The British and Americans know about it, but rather than expose their source they're going to let it happen the plane will blow up.
Coventry all over again.
The wheel turns, nothing is ever new.
Well, you're looking all better.
How you feeling? Like putting a bullet in your brain, sir.
They'd pin a medal on me if I did sir.
The Coventry conundrum.
What do you think of my solution? The flight of the dead.
Plane blows up midair, mission accomplished for the terrorists, hundreds of casualties, but nobody dies.
Neat, don't you think? You've been stumbling around the fringes of this one for ages.
Or were you too bored to notice the pattern? They wouldn't let us see Granddad when he was dead.
She's not my real aunt I know human ash.
We ran a similar project with the Germans a while back, though I believe one of our passengers didn't make the flight.
But that's the deceased for you late, in every sense of the word.
How is the plane going to fly? Of course, unmanned aircraft, hardly new.
It doesn't fly.
It will never fly.
This entire project is cancelled.
The terrorist cells have been informed we know about the bomb.
We can't fool them now.
We've lost everything.
One fragment of one email, and months and years of planning finished.
Your MOD man.
That's all it takes.
One lonely, naive man, desperate to show off, and a woman clever enough to make him feel special.
You should screen your defence people more carefully.
I'm not talking about the MOD man, Sherlock, I'm talking about you! The damsel in distress.
In the end, are you really so obvious? Because this was textbook.
The promise of love, the pain of loss, the joy of redemption.
Then give him a puzzle and watch him dance.
Don't be absurd! Absurd? How quickly did you decipher that email for her? Was it the full minute? Or were you really eager to impress? I think it was less than five seconds.
I drove you into her path.
I'm sorry, I didn't know.
Mr Holmes, I think we need to talk.
So do I, there are a number of aspects I'm still not clear on.
Not you, Junior, you're done now.
There's more, loads more.
On this phone I've got secrets, pictures and scandals that could topple your whole world.
You have no idea how much havoc I can cause and exactly one way to stop me.
Unless you want to tell your masters that your biggest security leak is your own little brother.
We have people who can get into this.
I tested that theory for you.
I let Sherlock Holmes try it for six months.
Sherlock, dear, tell him what you found when you x-rayed my phone.
Four additional units wired inside the casing, I suspect containing acid or a small explosive.
Any attempt to open it will burn the hard drive.
Explosive.
It's more me.
Some data is always recoverable.
Take that risk.
You have a passcode to open this.
I deeply regret to say, we have people who can extract it from you.
Sherlock? There will be two passcodes one to open the phone, one to burn the drive.
Even under duress, you can't know which one she's given and there would be no second attempt.
He's good, isn't he? I should have him on a leash.
In fact, I might.
We destroy this, then.
No-one has the information.
Fine, good idea.
Unless there are lives of British citizens depending on the information you burn.
Are there? Telling you would be playing fair.
I'm not playing any more.
A list of my requests, and some ideas about my protection once they're granted.
I'd say it wouldn't blow much of a hole in the wealth of a nation, but then I'd be lying.
I imagine you'd like to sleep on it.
Thank you, yes.
Too bad.
Off you pop and talk to people.
You've been very thorough.
I wish our lot were half as good as you.
I can't take all the credit, I had a bit of help.
Jim Moriarty sends his love.
Yes, he's been in touch.
Seems desperate for my attention, which I'm sure can be arranged.
I had all this stuff and never knew what to do with it.
Thank God for the consultant criminal.
Gave me a lot of advice about how to play the Holmes boys.
Do you know what he calls you? The Ice Man and the Virgin.
Didn't even ask for anything, he just likes to cause trouble that's my kind of man.
And here you are, the dominatrix who brought a nation to its knees.
Nicely played.
No.
Sorry? I said no.
Very, very close, but no.
You got carried away.
The game was too elaborate, you were enjoying yourself too much.
There's no such thing as too much.
Enjoying the thrill of the chase is fine.
Craving the distraction of the game, I sympathise, but sentiment? Sentiment is a chemical defect found in the losing side.
Sentiment? What are you talking about? You.
Dear God.
Look at the poor man.
You don't actually think I was interested in you? Why? Because you're the great Sherlock Holmes, the clever detective in the funny hat? No.
Because I took your pulse.
Elevated.
Your pupils dilated.
I imagine John Watson thinks love's a mystery to me, but the chemistry is incredibly simple and very destructive.
When we first met, you told me that disguise is always a self-portrait - How true of you.
The combination to your safe, your measurements but this, this is far more intimate, this is your heart and you should never let it rule your head.
You could have chosen any number and walked out with everything.
But you just couldn't resist it, could you? I've always assumed that love is a dangerous disadvantage.
Thank you for the final proof.
Everything I said, it's not real.
I was just playing the game.
I know.
And this is just losing.
There you are, Brother, hope the contents make up for any inconvenience caused tonight.
I'm certain they will.
If you're feeling kind, lock her up, let her go and I doubt she'll survive long.
Are you expecting me to beg? Yes.
Please.
You're right.
I won't even last six months.
Sorry about dinner.
You don't smoke.
I also don't frequent cafes.
This the file on Irene Adler? Closed forever.
I am about to go and inform my brother or, if you prefer, you are that she somehow got herself into a witness protection scheme in America.
New name, new identity.
She will survive and thrive but he will never see her again.
Why would he care? He despised her at the end.
Won't even mention her by name, just 'The Woman'.
Is that loathing or a salute? One of a kind, the one woman who matters.
He's not like that.
He doesn't feel things that way, I don't think.
My brother has the brain of a scientist or a philosopher, yet he elects to be a detective.
What might we deduce about his heart? I don't know.
Neither do I.
But, initially, he wanted to be a pirate.
He'll be OK with this witness protection, never seeing her again he'll be fine.
I agree.
That's why I decided to tell him that.
Instead of what? She's dead.
She was captured by a terrorist cell in Karachi two months ago and beheaded.
It was definitely her? She's done this before.
I was thorough this time.
It would take Sherlock Holmes to fool me, and I don't think he was on hand, do you? So What shall we tell Sherlock? Clearly you've got news.
If it's about the Leeds triple murder, it was the gardener.
Did nobody notice the earring? Hi.
No, it's, um it's about Irene Adler.
Well? Something happened? Has she come back? No, she's I bumped into Mycroft downstairs, he had to take a call.
Is she back in London? No She's She's in America.
America? Got herself on a witness protection scheme, apparently.
Don't know how she swung it, but well, you know.
I know what? You won't be able to see her again.
Why would I want to see her again? Didn't say you did.
Is that her file? Yes, I was going to take it back to Mycroft.
Do you want to No.
Listen, actually But I will have the camera-phone though.
There's nothing on it, it's been stripped I know, but I I'll still have it.
I've got to give this back to Mycroft, you can't keep it.
Sherlock, I have to give this to Mycroft, it's the government's now Please.
Thank you.
Well, I'd better take this back.
Yes.
Did she ever text you again, after all that? Once, a few months ago.
What did she say? "Goodbye, Mr Holmes.
" When I say run run! The Woman.
THE Woman.
Oh, hello.
Are you all right? What is it, dear? Are you lost? - Well, that was tedious! - You went on the Tube like that? None of the cabs would take me.
Nothing? - Military coup in Uganda - Hmm.
Hmm.
Another photo of you with the Oh, um, Cabinet re-shuffle Nothing of importance! Oh, God! John, I need some.
Get me some! - No.
- Get me some! No! Cold turkey.
We agreed.
No matter what.
Anyway, you've paid everyone off, remember? No one within a two-mile radius will sell you any.
Stupid idea! Whose idea was that? Mrs Hudson! Look, Sherlock, you're doing really well.
Don't give up now! Tell me where they are.
Please.
Tell me.
- Please.
- Can't help, sorry.
I'll let you know next week's lottery numbers.
Oh, it was worth a try.
- Yoo-hoo! - My secret supply.
What have you done with my secret supply? - Hey? - Cigarettes! What have you done with them? Where are they? You know you never let me touch your things.
Oh! Chance would be a fine thing.
- I thought you weren't my housekeeper? - I'm not.
How about a nice cuppa? And perhaps you could put away your harpoon.
I need something stronger than tea.
Perhaps 7% stronger.
You've been to see Mr Chatterjee again.
- Pardon? - Sandwich shop.
That's a new dress, but there's flour on the sleeve.
You wouldn't dress like that for baking.
- Sherlock.
- Thumbnail, tiny traces of foil.
Been at the scratch-cards again.
We all know where that leads, don't we? Mmm, Casbah Nights.
Pretty racy for first thing on a Monday morning, wouldn't you agree? I've written a little blog on the identification of perfumes.
It's on the website.
You should look it up! - Please! - I wouldn't pin your hopes on that cruise with Mr Chatterjee.
He's got a wife in Doncaster - that nobody knows about.
- Sherlock! Well, nobody except me.
I don't know what you're talking about, I really don't! What the bloody hell was all that about? You don't understand.
Go after her and apologise.
- Apologise? - Mmm-hmm.
Oh, John, I envy you so much.
- You envy me? - Your mind.
It's so placid, straightforward, barely used.
Mine's like an engine, racing out of control.
A rocket tearing itself to pieces, trapped on the launch pad.
- I need a case! - You've just solved one! By harpooning a dead pig, apparently.
Ah! That was this morning! When's the next one? Nothing on the website? "Dear Mr Sherlock Holmes, I can't find Bluebell anywhere.
"Please, please, please, can you help?" - Bluebell? - A rabbit, John! - Oh.
- Ah, but there's more.
Before Bluebell disappeared, it turned luminous.
"Like a fairy!" according to little Kirsty.
Then the next morning, Bluebell was gone! Hutch still locked, no sign of a forced entry.
What am I saying? This is brilliant.
Phone Lestrade, - tell him there's an escaped rabbit.
- You're serious? - It's this or Cluedo.
- No.
- We are never playing that again.
- Why not? Because it's not actually possible for the victim to have done it, - Sherlock, that's why.
- It was the only possible solution.
- It's not in the rules.
- Well, then the rules are wrong! - Single ring.
- Maximum pressure, just under the half-second.
Client! It's always been a place of myth and legend.
But is there something else lurking out here? Something very real? Because Dartmoor is also home to one of the government's most secretive operation.
; The Chemical and Biological Weapons Research Centre, which is said to be even more sensitive than Porton Down.
Since the end of the Second World War, there have been persistent stories about the Baskerville experiments.
Genetic mutations.
Animals grown for the battlefield.
There are many who believe that within this compound in the heart of this ancient wilderness there are horrors beyond imagining.
But the real question is are all of them still inside? I was just a kid.
It was on the moor, it was dark, but I know what I saw.
I know what killed my father: - What did you see? - Oh, I I was just about to say.
Yes, in a TV interview.
I prefer to do my own editing.
Yes.
Sorry, yes, of course.
Excuse me.
- In your own time.
- But quite quickly.
- Do you know Dartmoor, Mr Holmes? - No.
It's an amazing place.
It's like nowhere else, it's sort of bleak but beautiful.
Hmm.
Not interested, moving on.
We used to go for walks after my Mum died, my Dad and me.
Every evening we'd go out onto the moor.
Yes, good, skipping to the night that your dad was violently killed.
Where did that happen? There's a place, it's a sort of local landmark called Dewer's Hollow.
That's an ancient name for the Devil.
So? Did you see the Devil that night? Yes.
It was huge.
Coal black fur with red eyes.
It got him.
Tore at him, tore him apart.
I can't remember anything else, they found me the next morning just wandering on the moor.
My Dad's body was never found.
Hmm.
Red eyes, coal black fur.
Enormous.
Some sort of dog, wolf? Or a genetic experiment? - Are you laughing at me, Mr Holmes? - Why, are you joking? My Dad was always going on about the things they were doing at Baskerville.
About the type of monsters they were breeding there.
People used to laugh at him.
At least the TV people took me seriously.
- I assume did wonders for Devon tourism.
- Yeah Henry, whatever did happen to your father, it was 20 years ago.
Why come to us now? I'm not sure you can help me, Mr Holmes, since you find it all so funny! - Because of what happened last night.
- Why? What happened last night? - How How did you know? - I didn't know, I noticed.
Came up from Devon on the first available train this morning.
You had a disappointing breakfast and a cup of black coffee.
The girl in the seat across the aisle fancied you.
Although you were initially keen, you've now changed your mind.
You are, however, extremely anxious to have your first cigarette of the day.
Sit down, Mr Knight.
And do please smoke, I'd be delighted.
- How on earth did you notice all that? - It's not important Punched-out holes where your ticket's been checked.
- Not now, Sherlock.
- Oh, please? - I've been cooped up in here for ages.
- You're just showing off.
Of course.
I am a show-off.
That's what we do.
Train napkin you used to mop up the spilled coffee, strength of the stain shows that you didn't take milk.
There are traces of ketchup on it and round your lips and on your sleeve.
Cooked breakfast.
Or the nearest thing those trains can manage, - probably a sandwich.
- How did you know it was disappointing? Is there any other type of breakfast on a train? The girl, female handwriting's quite distinctive, wrote her phone number down on the napkin.
I can tell from the angle she wrote at that she was sat across from you on the other side of the aisle.
Later, after she'd got off, I imagine, you used the napkin to mop up your spilled coffee, accidentally smudging the numbers.
You've been over the last four digits yourself with another pen so you wanted to keep the number.
Just now, though, you used the napkin to blow your nose.
Maybe you're not that into her after all.
Then there's the nicotine stains on your fingers, your shaking fingers.
I know the signs.
No chance to smoke one on the train, no time to roll one before you got a cab here.
It's just after 9:15, you're desperate.
The first train from Exeter to London leaves at 5:46 a.
m.
You got the first one possible, so something important must have happened last night.
Am I wrong? No.
You're right.
You're You're completely, exactly right.
- Bloody hell, I heard you were quick.
- It's my job.
Now shut up and smoke! Henry, your parents both died and you were, what, seven years old? I know, but That must be quite a trauma.
Have you ever thought that maybe you invented this story, this to account for it? - That's what Dr Mortimer says.
- Who? - His therapist.
- My therapist.
Obviously.
Louise Mortimer.
She's the reason I came back to Dartmoor.
She thinks I have to face my demons.
And what happened when you went back to Dewer's Hollow last night, Henry? You went there on the advice of your therapist and now you're consulting a detective.
What did you see that changed everything? It's a strange place, the Hollow.
Makes you feel so cold inside, so afraid.
Yes, if I wanted poetry, I'd read john's emails to his girlfriends, much funnier.
What did you see? Footprints.
On the exact spot where I saw my father torn apart.
- A man's or a woman's? - Neither.
- They were - Is that it? Nothing else? - Footprints.
Is that all? - Yes, but they were No, sorry, Dr Mortimer wins, childhood trauma masked by an invented memory.
Boring! Goodbye, Mr Knight.
Thank you for smoking.
But what about the footprints? Oh, well, they're probably pawprints, could be anything, therefore nothing.
Off to Devon with you.
Have a cream tea on me.
Mr Holmes, they were the footprints of a gigantic hound! - Say that again? - I found footprints, they were No, no, no, your exact words.
Repeat your exact words from a moment ago, exactly as you said them.
Mr Holmes, they were the footprints of a gigantic hound.
- I'll take the case.
- Sorry, what? Thank you for bringing this to my attention, it's very promising.
No, no, no.
Sorry, what? A minute ago footprints were boring, now they've very promising? It's got nothing to do with footprints.
As ever, John, you weren't listening.
- Baskerville, ever heard of it? - Vaguely.
It's very hush-hush.
- Sounds like a good place to start.
- Ah, you'll come down, then? No, I can't leave London at the moment, far too busy.
But don't worry, I'm putting my best man onto it.
Always rely on John to send me all the relevant data, as he never understands a word of it himself.
What are you talking about, you're busy? You don't have a case.
- A minute ago you were complaining - Bluebell, John! I've got Bluebell.
The case of the vanishing glow-in-the-dark rabbit.
- NATO's in uproar.
- Oh, sorry.
You're not coming, then? Oh! Okay.
Okay.
I don't need those any more, I'm going to Dartmoor.
You go on ahead, Henry, we'll follow later.
Sorry, so you are coming? Twenty-year-old disappearance? A monstrous hound? I wouldn't miss this for the world! Oh! Looks like Mrs Hudson finally got to the wife in Doncaster.
Hmm.
Wait till she finds out about the one in Islamabad.
Paddington Station, please.
There's Baskerville.
Uh, that's Grimpen village.
So that must be Yes, Dewer's Hollow.
- What's that? - Hmm? A minefield? Technically, Baskerville's an army base, so I guess they've always been keen - to keep people out.
- Clearly.
All right.
Three tours a day.
Tell your friends.
Tell anyone! Don't be strangers and remember, stay away from the moor at night, if you value your lives! Take care.
It's cold.
That part doesn't change.
What does? Oh, there's something else.
It's a word.
Liberty.
- Liberty? - There's another word.
In.
I-N.
"Liberty In.
" What do you think it means? Eh, sorry we couldn't do a double room for you boys.
That's fine.
We're not - There you go.
- Oh, ta.
I'll just get your change.
Ta.
Well, there you go.
I couldn't help noticing, on the map of the moor, a skull and crossbones? Oh, that.
- Pirates? - Eh, no, no.
The Great Grimpen Minefield, they call it.
- Oh, right.
- It's not what you think.
It's the Baskerville testing site.
It's been going for 80-odd years.
I'm not sure anyone really knows what's there any more.
- Explosives? - Oh, not just explosives.
Break into that place and if you're lucky you just get blown up, so they say.
In case you're planning a nice wee stroll.
Ta, I'll remember.
Aye.
No, it buggers up tourism a bit, so thank God for the demon hound! - Did you see that show? The documentary? - Quite recently, yeah.
God bless Henry Knight and his monster from hell.
- You ever seen it? The Hound? - Me? No, no.
Eh, Fletcher has.
He runs the walks, the monster walks, for the tourists, you know? He's seen it.
That's handy.
For trade.
I'm just saying we've been rushed off our feet, Billy.
Yeah, lots of monster hunters.
Doesn't take much these days.
One mention on Twitter and woomph! - We're out of WKD.
- All right.
What with the monster and the ruddy prisoner, I don't know how we sleep nights, do you, Gary? - Like a baby.
- That's not true.
He's a snorer.
- Hey! Shh.
- Is yours a snorer? Got any crisps? Yeah.
No.
All right? All right.
Take care.
Mind if I join you? It's not true, is it? You haven't actually seen this Hound thing? - You from the papers? - No.
Nothing like that.
Just curious.
- Have you seen it? - Maybe.
- Got any proof? - Why would I tell you if I did? - Excuse me.
- I called Henry - Bet's off, John.
Sorry.
- What? - Bet? - My plan needs darkness.
We've got another half an hour of light Wait, wait.
What bet? Oh, I bet John here 50 quid that you couldn't prove you'd seen the Hound.
Yeah, the guys in the pub said you could.
Well, you're going to lose your money, mate.
- Yea h? - Yeah.
I seen it.
Only about a month ago.
Up at the Hollow.
It was foggy, mind.
Couldn't make much out.
- I see.
No witnesses, I suppose? - No, but - Never are.
- No, wait.
There.
Is that it? It's not exactly proof, is it? - Sorry, John.
I win.
- Wait, wait! That's not all.
People don't like going up there, you know.
To the Hollow.
- Gives them a bad sort of feeling.
- Ooh, is it haunted? - Is that supposed to convince me? - Nah, don't be stupid! Nothing like that.
But I reckon there is something out there.
Something from Baskerville.
Escaped.
- A cone? Super-dog? - Maybe.
God knows what they've been spraying on us all these years.
Or putting in the water.
I wouldn't trust them as far as I could spit.
Is that the best you've got? I had a mate once who worked for the MOD.
One weekend we were meant to go fishing, but he never showed up.
Well, not till late.
When he did, he was white as a sheet.
I can see him now.
"I've seen things today, Fletch," he said, "I ain't never want to see again.
"Terrible things.
" He'd been sent to some secret army place.
Porton Down, maybe? Maybe Baskerville? Or somewhere else.
In the labs there, the really secret labs, he said he'd seen terrible things.
Rats as big as dogs, he said.
And dogs, dogs the size of horses.
Uh, we did say 50? Mmm.
Ta.
Pass, please? Thank you.
We got ID for Baskerville? How? It's not specific to this place.
It's my brother's.
Access all areas.
I, um acquired it ages ago, just in case.
- Brilliant.
- What's the matter? - We'll get caught.
- No, we won't.
Well, not just yet.
Caught in five minutes.
"Oh, hi! We just thought "we'd come and have a wander round your top-secret weapons base.
" "Really? Great! Come in, kettle's just boiled.
" That's if we don't get shot.
- Here you are.
- Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Straight through, sir.
Mycroft's name literally opens doors.
I've told you.
He practically is the British Government.
I reckon we've got about 20 minutes before they realise something's wrong.
- What is it? Are we in trouble? - "Are we in trouble, sir?" - Yes, sir.
Sorry, sir.
- You were expecting us? Your ID showed up straight away, Mr Holmes.
Corporal Lyons.
Security.
- Is there something wrong, sir? - Well, I hope not, Corporal.
I hope not.
It's just we don't get inspected here, you see, sir.
It just doesn't happen.
Never heard of a spot check? Captain John Watson.
Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers.
Sir! Major Barrymore won't be pleased, sir.
He'll want to see you both.
I'm afraid we won't have time for that.
We'll need the full tour.
Right away.
Carry on.
- That's an order, Corporal.
- Yes, sir.
- Nice touch.
- Haven't pulled rank in ages.
- Enjoy it? - Oh, yeah.
How many animals do you keep down here? Lots, sir.
Any ever escape? They'd have to know how to use that lift, sir.
We're not breeding them that clever.
Unless they have help.
Ah.
And you are? I'm sorry, Dr Frankland, I'm just showing these gentlemen around.
Ah, new faces! How nice.
Careful you don't get stuck here, though.
I only came to fix a tap.
How far down does that lift go? - Quite a way, sir.
- Mmm-hmm.
And what's down there? Well, we have to keep the bins somewhere, sir.
This way, please, gentlemen.
So what exactly is it that you do here? I thought you'd know, sir.
This being an inspection.
Well, I'm not an expert, am I? Everything from stem cell research to trying to cure the common cold, sir.
- But mostly weaponry? - Of one sort or another, yes.
- Biological, chemical - One war ends, another begins, sir.
New enemies to fight.
We have to be prepared.
Okay, Michael.
Let's try Halo 5 next time.
- Dr Stapleton.
- Stapleton.
Yes.
Who's this? Priority ultra, ma'am.
Orders from on high.
- An inspection.
- Really? We're to be accorded every courtesy, Dr Stapleton.
What's your role at Baskerville? Accorded every courtesy, isn't that the idea? I'm not free to say.
Official Secrets.
Oh, you most certainly are free.
And I suggest you remain that way.
I have a lot of fingers in a lot of pies.
I like to mix things up.
Genes, mostly.
Now and again, actual fingers.
- Stapleton, I knew I knew your name.
- I doubt it.
People say there's no such thing as coincidence.
What dull lives they must lead.
Have you been talking to my daughter? Why did Bluebell have to die, Dr Stapleton? - The rabbit? - Disappeared from inside a locked hutch, - which was always suggestive.
- The rabbit? Clearly an inside job.
- Oh, you reckon? - Why? Because it glowed in the dark? I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about.
Who are you? Well, I think we've seen enough for now, Corporal.
Thank you so much.
- That's it? - That's it.
It's this way, isn't it? Just a minute! Did we break into a military base to investigate a rabbit? Huh.
23 minutes.
Mycroft's getting slow.
Hello.
Again.
- Uh, Major, this is - Bloody outrageous! Why wasn't I told? Major Barrymore, is it? Yes.
Well.
Good.
Very good.
We're very impressed.
- Aren't we, Mr Holmes? - Deeply.
Hugely.
The whole point of Baskerville was to eliminate - this kind of bureaucratic nonsense! - I'm so sorry, Major.
- Inspections - New policy.
You can't remain unmonitored forever.
Goodness knows what you'd get up to.
- Keep walking.
- Sir! - ID unauthorised, sir! - What? - I've just had the call.
- Is that right? Who are you? Look, there's obviously been some kind of mistake.
Clearly not Mycroft Holmes.
Computer error, Major.
It'll all have to go in the report.
- What the hell's going on? - It's all right, Major.
- I know exactly who these gentlemen are.
- You do? Yeah.
I'm getting a little slow on faces, but Mr Holmes here isn't someone I expected to show up in this place.
- Ah, well - Good to see you again, Mycroft.
I had the honour of meeting Mr Holmes at the WHO conference in Brussels, was it? - Vienna.
- Vienna.
That's it.
This is Mr Mycroft Holmes, Major.
There's obviously been a mistake.
On your head be it, Dr Frankland.
- I'll show them out, Corporal.
- Very well, sir.
- Thank you.
- This is about Henry Knight, isn't it? I thought so.
I knew he wanted help but I didn't realise he was going to contact Sherlock Holmes.
Don't worry, I know who you really are.
I'm never off your website.
Thought you'd be wearing the hat, though.
That wasn't my hat.
- I hardly recognise him without the hat.
- It wasn't my hat.
- I love the blog, too, Dr Watson.
- Oh, cheers.
The Pink thing! And that one about the Aluminium Crutch! You know Henry Knight? Well, I knew his dad better.
He had all sorts of mad theories about this place.
Still, he was a good friend.
Listen, I can't really talk now.
Here's my cell number.
If I can help, with Henry, give me a call.
I never did ask, Dr Frankland.
What exactly is it that you do here? Mr Holmes, I would love to tell you, but then of course I'd have to kill you.
That would be tremendously ambitious of you.
Tell me about Dr Stapleton.
I never speak ill of a colleague.
But you'd speak well of one, which you're clearly omitting to do.
I do seem to be, don't I? - I'll be in touch.
- Any time.
- So? - So? What was all that about the rabbit? Oh, please.
Can we not do this this time? - Do what? - You being all mysterious with your cheekbones, and turning your coat collar up so you look cool.
- I don't do that.
- Yeah, you do.
So, the email from Kirsty, the missing luminous rabbit Kirsty Stapleton, whose mother specialises in genetic manipulation.
She made her daughter's rabbit glow in the dark? Probably a fluorescent gene.
Removed and spliced into the specimen, simple enough these days.
So So we know that Dr Stapleton performs secret genetic experiments on animals.
The question is has she been working on something deadlier than a rabbit? To be fair, that is quite a wide field.
- Hi.
Come in.
Come in.
- Hi.
This is, uh Are you, um rich? - Yeah.
- Right.
It's a couple of words.
That's what I keep seeing.
- " Liberty.
" - Liberty? "Liberty" and "In.
" It's just that.
- Are you finished? - Mmm.
Mean anything to you? "Liberty in death", isn't that the expression? - Mmm.
- The only true freedom? - What now, then? - Sherlock's got a plan.
- Yes.
- Right.
We take you back out onto the moor.
- Okay.
- And see if anything attacks you.
- What? - That should bring things to a head.
At night? - You want me to go out there at night? - That's your plan? - Brilliant.
- Do you have any better ideas? - That's not a plan.
- If there is a monster out there, John, there's only one thing to do, find out where it lives.
Sher.
U-M-Q-R-A.
UMQRA? Sherlock.
Sherlock.
Sherlock! Met a friend of yours.
- What? - Dr Frankland.
Oh, right.
Bob, yeah.
He seems pretty concerned about you.
He's a worrier.
Bless him.
He's been very kind to me since I came back.
- He knew your father? - Yeah.
But he works at Baskerville.
Didn't your dad have a problem with that? Well, mates are mates, aren't they? I mean, look at you and John.
What about us? Well, I mean, he's a pretty straightforward bloke and you They agreed never to talk about work, Uncle Bob and my dad.
Dewer's Hollow.
Sherlock? Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God Did you see it? - Did you hear that? - We saw it! We saw it.
No.
I didn't see anything.
What? What are you talking about? I didn't see anything! Look, he must have seen it! I saw it.
He must have.
He must have.
I Why? Why? Why would he say that? It-it-it was there.
It was.
Henry? Henry, I need you to sit down.
- Try and relax, please.
- I'm okay.
I'm okay.
I'm going to give you something to help you sleep.
- All right? - This is good news, John.
It's it's it's good.
I'm not crazy.
There is a Hound.
There is And Sherlock, he saw it too.
No matter what he says.
He saw it.
Well, he is in a pretty bad way.
He's manic.
Totally convinced there's some mutant super-dog roaming the moors.
And there isn't, though, is there? 'Cause if people knew how to make a mutant super-dog, we'd know.
They'd be for sale.
I mean, that's how it works.
Listen, on the moor, I saw someone signalling.
Morse.
I guess it's Morse.
Doesn't seem to make much sense.
U-M-Q-R-A.
Does that mean anything? So, okay.
What have we got? We know there's footprints, 'cause Henry found them.
So did the tour guide.
But we all heard something.
Maybe we should just look for whoever's got a big dog.
- Henry's right.
- What? I saw it, too.
- What? - I saw it, too, John.
- Just just a minute.
You saw what? - A hound.
Out there in the Hollow.
A gigantic hound! Um Look, Sherlock.
We have to be rational about this.
Okay? Now, you, of all people, can't just Let's just stick to what we know, yes? Stick to the facts.
Once you've ruled out the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be true.
What does that mean? Huh.
Look at me, I'm afraid, John.
Afraid.
Sherlock I've always been able to keep myself distant.
Divorce myself from feelings.
But, look, you see? My body's betraying me.
Interesting, yes? Emotions.
The grit on the lens, the fly in the ointment! Yeah, all right, Spock.
Just take it easy.
You've been pretty wired lately.
You know you have.
I think you've just gone out there and got yourself a bit worked up.
Worked up? - It was dark and scary - Me? There's nothing wrong with me.
Sherlock? - Sherlock? - There is nothing wrong with me! Do you understand? You want me to prove it, yes? We're looking for a dog, yes? A great big dog.
That's your brilliant theory.
Cherchez le chien! Good.
Excellent.
Yes! Where shall we start? How about them? The sentimental widow and her son, the unemployed fisherman? - The answer's yes.
- Yes? She's got a West Highland terrier called Whisky.
- Not exactly what we're looking for.
- Sherlock, for God's sake.
Look at the jumper he's wearing, hardly worn.
Clearly he's uncomfortable in it.
Maybe it's because of the material, more likely the hideous pattern.
Suggests it's a present.
Probably Christmas.
So, he wants into his Mother's good books.
Why? Almost certainly money.
He's treating her to a meal, but his own portion is small.
That means he wants to impress her, but he's trying to economise on his own food.
- Well, maybe he's just not hungry.
- No.
Small plate.
A starter.
He's practically licked it clean.
She's nearly finished her pavlova.
If she'd treated him, he'd have had as much as he wanted.
He's hungry, all right.
And not well off.
You can tell that from the state of his cuffs and shoes.
"How do you know she's his mother?" Who else would give him a Christmas present like that? Well, it could be an aunt or an older sister, but mother's more likely.
Now, he was a fisherman.
The scarring pattern on his hands is very distinctive, fish-hooks.
They're all quite old now, which suggests he's been unemployed for some time.
Not much industry in this part of the world, so he's turned to his widowed mother for help.
"Widowed?" Yes! Obviously.
She's got a man's wedding ring on a chain around her neck, clearly her late husband's and too big for her finger.
She's well-dressed but her jewellery's cheap.
She could afford better, but she's kept it.
Sentimental.
Now, the dog.
Tiny little hairs all over the leg from where it gets a little bit too friendly.
But no hairs above the knee, suggesting it's a small dog, probably a terrier.
In fact, it is a West Highland terrier called Whisky.
"How the hell do you know that, Sherlock?" Because she was on the same train as us and I heard her calling its name.
And that's not cheating, that's listening.
I use my senses, John, unlike some people.
So, you see, I am fine.
In fact, I've never been better.
So just leave me alone.
Yeah, okay.
Okay.
Why would you listen to me? I'm just your friend.
- I don't have friends.
- No.
I wonder why? Oh, Mr Selden! You've done it again! Oh.
I keep catching it with me belt.
Oh, God.
Oh Sh So? Oh, you're a bad man.
Morning! - No, I mean - What is it? Um, more wine, Doctor? - You trying to get me drunk, Doctor? - The thought never occurred.
Because a while ago, I thought you were chatting me up.
Oh! Where did I go wrong? When you started asking me about my patients.
No, you see, I am one of Henry's oldest friends.
Yeah, and he's one of my patients, so I can't talk about him.
Though he has told me about all his oldest friends.
Which one are you? A new one? Okay, what about his father? He wasn't one of your patients.
Wasn't he some sort of conspiracy nutter, theorist? - You're only a nutter if you're wrong.
- Hmm.
- Was he wrong? - I should think so.
But he got fixated on Baskerville, didn't he? With what they were doing in there.
Couldn't Henry have gone the same way? Started imagining a hound? Why do you think I'm going to talk about this? Because I think you're worried about him.
And because I am a doctor, too, and because I have another friend who might be having the same problem.
- Dr Watson! - Hi.
Hello.
How's the investigation going? - Hello.
- What investigation? Didn't you know? Don't you read the blog? - Sherlock Holmes! - Sherlock who? Private detective.
- This is his PA.
- PA? - Well, live-in PA.
- Perfect.
- Live-in.
- Uh, this is Dr Mortimer.
Henry's therapist.
Oh, hello.
Bob Frankland.
Listen, tell Sherlock I've been keeping an eye on Stapleton.
Any time he wants a little chat All right? - Oh.
- Ah.
Why don't you buy him a drink? I think he likes you.
Morning! Oh, how are you feeling? I'm I didn't sleep very well.
That's a shame.
Shall I make you some coffee? Oh, look.
You've got damp.
Listen.
Last night Why did you say you hadn't seen anything? I mean, I only saw the Hound for a minute but - Hound.
- What? Why do you call it a hound? Why a hound? - Why? What do you mean? - It's odd, isn't it? Strange choice of words, archaic.
That's why I took the case.
"Mr Holmes, they were the footprints of a gigantic hound.
" Why say "hound"? - I don't know, I've never - Actually, let's skip the coffee.
You, uh, getting anywhere with that Morse Code? - No.
- U-M-Q-R-A, wasn't it? - UMQRA.
- Nothing.
- UMQ - Look, forget it.
I thought I was onto something, I wasn't.
- Sure? - Yeah.
How about Louise Mortimer? Did you get anywhere with her? - No.
- Too bad.
Did you get any information? Hmm.
You're being funny now? Thought it might break the ice a bit.
Funny doesn't suit you.
I'd stick to ice.
John - It's fine.
No, wait.
What happened last night, something happened to me, something I've not really experienced before.
Yes, you said.
Fear.
"Sherlock Holmes got scared," you said.
No, no, no.
It was more than that, John.
It was doubt.
I felt doubt.
Always been able to trust my senses, the evidence of my own eyes, until last night.
You can't actually believe that you saw some kind of monster? No, I can't believe that.
But I did see it.
So the question is how? How? Yes.
Yeah, right, good.
So, you got something to go on, then? Good luck with that.
Listen, what I said before, John, I meant it.
I don't have friends.
I've just got one.
Right.
John? John! - You are amazing! You are fantastic! - Yes, all right.
You don't have to overdo it.
You've never been the most luminous of people but as a conductor of light, you are unbeatable.
- Cheers.
- What? Some people who aren't geniuses have an amazing ability to stimulate it in others.
Hang on, you were saying sorry a minute ago, don't spoil it.
Go on.
What have I done that's so bloody stimulating? Yeah? What if it's not a word? What if it is individual letters? - You think it's an acronym? - Absolutely no idea.
What the hell are you doing here? Oh, nice to see you, too.
I'm on holiday, would you believe? No.
I wouldn't.
- Hello, John.
- Greg.
I heard you were in the area.
What are you up to? You after this Hound of Hell, like on the telly? I'm waiting for an explanation, Inspector.
Why are you here? I've told you, I'm on holiday.
You're brown as a nut.
You're clearly just back from your holidays.
Maybe I fancied another one.
- Oh, this is Mycroft, isn't it? - Now, look Of course it is.
One mention of Baskerville and he sends down my handler to spy on me, incognito.
Is that why you're calling yourself Greg? - That's his name.
- Is it? Yes, if you'd ever bothered to find out.
Look, I'm not your handler.
And I don't just do what your brother tells me.
Actually, you could be just the man we want.
- Why? - I've not been idle, Sherlock.
I think I might have found something.
Here.
Didn't know if it was relevant, it's starting to look like it might be.
That is an awful lot of meat for a vegetarian restaurant.
- Excellent.
- A nice, scary inspector from Scotland Yard who can put in a few calls might come in very handy.
Shop! - What's this? - Coffee.
I made coffee.
- You never make coffee.
- I just did.
Don't you want it? You don't have to keep apologising.
Thanks.
Mmm, I don't take sugar.
These records go back nearly two months.
That's nice.
It's good.
Was that when you had the idea? After the TV show went out? It's me.
It was me.
I'm sorry, Gary, I couldn't help it.
I had a bacon sandwich at Cal's wedding and one thing just led to another.
Nice try.
Look, we were just trying to give things a bit of a boost, you know? A great big dog run wild up on the moor, it was heaven sent.
It was like us having our own Loch Ness Monster.
- Where do you keep it? - There's an old mine shaft.
It's not too far.
He was all right there.
Was? We couldn't control the bloody thing! It was vicious.
And then a month ago, Billy took him to the vet - and, you know - It's dead? - Put down.
- Yeah.
No choice.
So it's over.
- It was just a joke, you know? - Yeah.
Hilarious.
You've nearly driven a man out of his mind.
You know he's actually pleased you're here? Secretly pleased.
Is he? That's nice.
I suppose he likes having all the same faces back together.
- Appeals to his his - Asperger's? So, you believe them about having the dog destroyed? - No reason not to.
- Well, hopefully there's no harm done.
Not quite sure what I'd charge them with anyway.
I'll have a word with the local force.
Right, that's that, then.
Catch you later.
I'm enjoying this! It's nice to get London out of your lungs.
So that was their dog that people saw out on the moor? - Looks like it.
- But that wasn't what you saw.
- That wasn't just an ordinary dog.
- No.
It was immense, had burning red eyes and it was glowing, John, its whole body was glowing.
I've got a theory, but I need to get back into Baskerville to test it.
How? You can't pull off the ID trick again.
Might not have to.
Hello, brother dear.
How are you? Afternoon, sir, if you could turn the engine off.
Thank you.
I need to see Major Barrymore as soon as we get inside.
- Right.
- Which means you'll have to start - the search for the Hound.
- Okay.
In the labs.
Stapleton's first.
Could be dangerous.
Oh, you know I'd love to.
I'd love to give you unlimited access to this place.
- Why not? - It's a simple enough request, Major.
I've never heard of anything so bizarre.
You're to give me 24 hours.
It's what I've negotiated.
Not a second more.
I may have to comply with this order but I don't have to like it.
I don't know what the hell you expect to find here, anyway.
- Perhaps the truth.
- About what? Oh, I see! The big coat should have told me.
You're one of the conspiracy lot, aren't you? Well, then, go ahead.
Seek them out.
The monsters, the death rays, the aliens.
Have you got any of those? Oh, just wondering.
A couple.
Crash-landed here in the '60s.
We call them Abbott and Costello.
Good luck, Mr Holmes.
Oh, God! Oh! Ow! Come on.
What the Hello? No, come on.
Come on.
No, you've Don't be ridiculous.
Pick up.
Damn it! Right.
Okay.
It's here.
It's in here with me! - Where are you? - Get me out, Sherlock.
You've got to get me out.
The big lab.
The first lab that we saw.
Oh! - John? John? - Now, Sherlock.
Please.
- All right.
I'll find you.
Keep talking.
- I daren't, it'll hear me.
Keep talking.
What are you seeing? John? - Yes, I'm here.
What can you see? I don't know.
I don't know, but I can hear it, though.
Did you hear that? Stay calm.
Stay calm.
Can you see it? - Can you see it? - No.
I I can see it.
It's here.
It's here! - Are you all right? John? - Jesus Christ! It was the Hound! Sherlock.
It was here.
I swear it, Sherlock.
It must It must Did you see it? You must have! - It's all right.
It's okay now.
- No, it's not! It's not okay! I saw it, I was wrong.
- Hmm.
Let's not jump to conclusions.
- What? - What did you see? - I told you, I saw the Hound.
- Huge? Red eyes? - Yes! - Glowing? - Yeah.
- No.
- What? I made up the bit about glowing.
You saw what you expected to see because I told you.
You have been drugged.
We have all been drugged.
- Drugged? - Can you walk? Of course I can walk.
Come on, then.
It's time to lay this ghost.
Oh, back again? - What's on your mind this time? - Murder, Dr Stapleton.
Refined, cold-blooded murder.
Will you tell little Kirsty what happened to Bluebell or shall I? - Okay, what do you want? - Can I borrow your microscope? Are you sure you're okay? You look very peaky.
No, I'm all right.
It was the GFP gene from a jellyfish, in case you're interested.
- What? - In the rabbits.
Hmm.
Great news.
Aequorea victoria, if you really want to know.
- Why? - Why not? We don't ask questions like that here.
It isn't done.
It was a mix-up, anyway.
My daughter ended up with one of the lab specimens, so poor Bluebell had to go.
- Your compassion's overwhelming.
- I know.
I hate myself sometimes.
So, come on, then, you can trust me, I'm a doctor, what else have you got hidden away up here? Listen, if you can imagine it, someone is probably doing it somewhere.
Of course they are.
- Cloning? - Yes, of course! Dolly the sheep, remember? - Human cloning? - Why not? And what about animals? Not sheep.
- Big animals.
- Size isn't a problem.
Not at all.
The only limits are ethics and the law.
And both those things can be very flexible.
But not here, not at Baskerville.
- It's not there! - Jesus! Nothing there! It doesn't make any sense.
- What were you expecting to find? - A drug, of course! It has to be a drug.
A hallucinogenic or a deliriant of some kind.
There's no trace of anything in the sugar.
- Sugar? - The sugar, yes.
It's a simple process of elimination.
I saw the Hound, saw it as my imagination expected me to see it.
A genetically engineered monster.
But I knew I couldn't believe the evidence of my own eyes, so there were seven possible reasons for it, the most possible being narcotics.
Henry Knight, he saw it, too.
But you didn't, John.
You didn't see it.
Now, we have eaten and drunk exactly the same things since we got to Grimpen, apart from one thing! You don't take sugar in your coffee.
I see.
So I took it from Henry's kitchen.
His sugar.
- But it's perfectly all right.
- But maybe it's not a drug.
No, it has to be a drug.
How did it get into our systems? How? There must be something.
Something Something Something buried deep.
Get out.
- What? - Get out.
- I need to go to my mind palace.
- Your what? He's not going to be doing much talking for a while, we may as well go.
- His what? - Oh, his mind palace.
It's a memory technique.
A sort of mental map.
You plot a map with a location.
It doesn't have to be a real place.
And then you deposit memories there.
Theoretically, you can never forget anything.
All you have to do is find your way back to it.
So this imaginary location could be anything, a house or a street? - Yeah.
- But he said palace.
- He said it was a palace.
- Yeah, well, he would, wouldn't he? You ain't nothing H.

Experiment in the CIA facility in Liberty, Indiana.
H-O-U-N-D.
That's as far as my access goes, I'm afraid.
There must be an override.
A password.
I imagine so, but that'd be Major Barrymore's.
Password.
Password.
Password.
He'd have sat here when he thought it up.
- Describe him to me.
- You've seen him.
- But describe him.
- He's a bloody martinet.
A throwback.
The sort they'd have sent into Suez.
Good.
Excellent.
Old-fashioned.
A traditionalist.
Not the sort of man that uses children's names as a password.
He loves his job.
Proud of it.
And this is work-related.
So, what's at eye level? Books.
Jane's Defence Weekly Bound copies.
Hannibal, Wellington.
Rommel.
Churchill's History of the English-Speaking People, all four volumes.
Churchill.
He's fond of Churchill.
Copy of The Downing Street Year.
; One, two, three, four, five separate biographies of Thatcher.
Mid-19805, at a guess.
Father and son.
Barrymore senior? Medals.
- Distinguished service order? - That date, I'd say Falklands veteran.
Right, so Thatcher's looking more likely a bet than Churchill.
So that's the password? No! With a man like Major Barrymore, only first-name terms would do.

A new deliriant drug which rendered its users incredibly suggestible.
They wanted to use it as an anti-personnel weapon to totally disorientate the enemy using fear and stimulus.
But they shut it down and hid it away in 1986.
Because of what it did to the subjects they tested it on? And what they did to others.
Prolonged exposure drove them insane.
Made them almost uncontrollably aggressive.
So, someone's been doing it again? Carrying on the experiments? Attempting to refine it, perhaps.
For the last 20 years.
- Who? - Those names mean anything to you? No.
Not a thing.
Five principal scientists, 20 years ago.
Maybe our friend's somewhere in the back of the picture.
Somebody who was old enough to be there at the time of the experiments in 1986.
Maybe somebody who says "cell phone" because of time spent in America.
- You remember, John? - Mmm-hmm.
Here's my cell number.
Gave us his number in case we needed him.
Oh, my God.
Bob Frankland.
But Bob doesn't even work on it.
I mean, he's a virologist.
- This was chemical warfare.
- That's where he started, though.
And he's never lost the certainty, the obsession that that drug really could work.
Nice of him to give us his number.
Let's arrange a little meeting.
Hello? - Who's this? - You've got to find Henry.
It's Louise Mortimer.
Louise, what's wrong? Henry was remembering, then He tried He's got a gun, he went for the gun and tried to What? He's gone! You've got to stop him.
I don't know what he might do.
- Where are you? - His house, I'm okay.
I'm okay.
Right.
Stay there, we'll get someone to you.
Okay? - Henry? - He's attacked her.
Gone? There's only one place he'll go to, back to where it all started.
Lestrade, get to the Hollow.
Dewer's Hollow, now! And bring a gun.
I'm sorry.
So sorry, Dad.
- Oh, Henry, no! No! - Get back, Dad! Get away from me! - Easy, Henry.
Easy.
just relax.
- I know what I am.
- I know what I tried to do! - Just put the gun down.
It's okay.
- No! No! I know what I am! - Yes.
I'm sure you do, Henry.
It's all been explained to you, hasn't it? - Explained very carefully.
- What? Someone needed to keep you quiet.
Needed to keep you as a child, to reassert the dream that you'd both clung on to because you had started to remember.
Remember now, Henry.
You've got to remember what happened here when you were a little boy.
I thought it had got my dad.
The Hound.
I thought Oh, Jesus! I don't know any more! - I don't! - No, Henry! Henry! Henry, remember, "Liberty, In.
" Two words.
Two words a frightened little boy saw here 20 years ago.
You'd started to piece things together, remember what really happened here that night.
It wasn't an animal, was it, Henry? Not a monster.
A man.
You couldn't cope.
You were just a child.
So you rationalised it into something very different.
And then you started to remember, so you had to be stopped.
Driven out of your mind so that no one would believe a word that you said.
Sherlock! Okay.
It's okay, mate.
But we saw it! The Hound.
Last night.
We did! There was a dog, Henry.
Leaving footprints, scaring witnesses.
But it was nothing more than an ordinary dog.
We both saw it.
Saw it as our drugged minds wanted us to see it.
Fear and stimulus.
That's how it works.
But there never was any monster.
Sherlock? - No! No, no, no, no, no! - Henry Sherlock! - No, no, no, no, no, no! - Henry? Sherlock? Are you seeing this? He is not drugged, Sherlock.
So what's that? - What is it? - All right! It's still there! But it's just a dog, Henry.
It's nothing more than an ordinary dog! My God! Oh, Christ! No! No! It's not you.
It's not you! - The fog.
- What? It's the fog! The drug, it's in the fog! Aerosol dispersant, that's what it said in those records.
Project H.
O.
U.
N.
D.
It's the fog.
A chemical minefield.
For God's sake, kill it! Kill it! Look at it, Henry.
- No, no, no.
- Come on, look at it! It's just You bastard.
You bastard! Twenty years! Twenty years of my life making no sense.
Why didn't you just kill me? Because dead men get listened to.
He needed to do more than kill you.
He had to discredit every word you ever said about your father.
And he had the means right at his feet.
A chemical minefield! Pressure pads in the ground, dosing you up every time that you came back here.
Murder weapon, scene of the crime, all at once.
Oh, this case, Henry! - Thank you, it's been brilliant.
- Sherlock.
What? Timing.
- Not good? - No, no, it's okay.
It's fine, because this means This means that my dad was right.
He'd found something out, hadn't he? And that's why you killed him, because he was right! And he'd found you right in the middle of an experiment.
Frankland! - Frankland! - Keep running.
Keep back! It's no use, Frankland! Come on! Hmm.
Thanks, Billy.
So they didn't have it put down, then? The dog.
Obviously.
Suppose they just couldn't bring themselves to do it.
I see.
No, you don't.
- No, I don't.
Sentiment? - Sentiment.
Mmm, listen, what happened to me in the lab? - Do you want some sauce with that? - I hadn't been to the Hollows.
How come I heard those things in there? Fear and stimulus, you said.
You must've been dosed with it elsewhere.
When you went to the lab, maybe.
You saw those pipes.
Pretty ancient, leaky as a sieve.
And they were carrying the gas, so - Um, ketchup, was it, or brown? - Hang on.
You thought it was in the sugar.
You were convinced it was in the sugar.
Better get going, actually.
There's a train that leaves in half an hour, so if you want Oh, God.
It was you.
You locked me in that bloody lab! I had to.
It was an experiment.
- An experiment? - Shh.
I was terrified, Sherlock.
I was scared to death! I thought the drug was in the sugar so I put the sugar in your coffee.
Then I arranged everything with Major Barrymore.
It was all totally scientific, laboratory conditions.
Well, literally.
It's in here with me.
All right.
Keep talking.
I'll find you.
- Keep talking.
- I daren't, it'll hear me.
Tell me what you're seeing.
I don't know, but I can hear it, though.
I knew what effect it had had on a superior mind, so I needed to try it on an average one.
You know what I mean.
But it wasn't in the sugar.
No, well, I wasn't to know you'd already been exposed to the gas.
- So you got it wrong.
- No.
You were wrong.
It wasn't in the sugar.
You got it wrong.
A bit.
Won't happen again.
Any long-term effects? None at all.
You'll be fine once you've excreted it.
We all will.
Think I might have taken care of that already.
- Where are you going? - Won't be a minute.
Got to see a man about a dog.
All right.
Let him go.
THUNDER RUMBLES Why today? Do you want to hear me say it? 18 months since our last appointment.
You read the papers? Sometimes And you watch telly? You know why I'm here.
I'm here because What happened, John? Sherl You need to get it out.
My best friend Sherlock Holmes is dead.
Falls Of The Reichenbach.
Turner's masterpiece.
Thankfully recovered, owing to the prodigious talent of Mr Sherlock Holmes.
APPLAUSE A small token of our gratitude.
Diamond cufflinks All my cuffs have buttons.
He means thank you.
Do I? Just say it.
Thank you.
Hang on.
Back together with my family, after my terrifying ordeal.
And we have one person to thank for my deliverance Sherlock Holmes.
APPLAUSE Tie pin.
I don't wear ties.
Shhh.
Peter Ricoletti Number one on Interpol's most wanted list since 1982.
We got him, and there's one person we have to thank for giving us the decisive leads.
With all his customary diplomacy and tact.
Sarcasm.
Yes.
We all chipped in.
Oh Put the hat on.
Put the hat on.
Yes, Sherlock, put it on.
Just get it over with.
"Boffin!" "Boffin Sherlock Holmes!" Everybody gets one.
Page five, column six, first sentence.
Why is it always the hat photograph?! "Bachelor John Watson.
" What kind of hat is it? What are they implying?! Is it a cap? Why has it got two fronts? It's a deerstalker.
"Frequently seen in the company of bachelor John Watson.
" What are you going to do, throw it? "Confirmed bachelor John Watson.
" A death frisbee! This is too much, we need to be more careful.
It's got flaps.
Ear flaps, it's an ear hat, John.
What do you mean, more careful? I mean, this isn't a deerstalker now, it's a Sherlock Holmes hat.
I mean, you're not exactly a private detective any more.
You're this far from famous.
Oh, it'll pass.
It better pass.
The press will turn, Sherlock, they always turn and they'll turn on you.
It really bothers you.
What? What people say.
Yes.
About me? why would it upset YOU? Just try to keep a low profile.
Find yourself a little case this week.
Stay out of the news.
MOBILE BLEEPS That's your phone.
Hmm, it keeps doing that.
So, did you just talk to him for a really long time? Oh, Henry Fishguard never committed suicide.
Bow Street runners missed everything.
Pressing case, is it? They're all pressing until they're solved.
Put your key back please.
Thank you.
Excuse me, sir.
Any metal objects, keys, mobile phones? You can go through.
Thank you.
Fancy a cuppa then, mate? Yeah, why not? Gilts at seven.
Dutch Telecoms in free-fall.
Thank you, Harvey.
What are you saying? Refuse them all parole and bring back the rope? Let's begin.
ALARM SOUNDS This is an emergency.

Oh no! POLICE SIRENS No rush.
MOBILE BLEEPS I'll get it, shall I? Here.
Not now, I'm busy.
Sherlock Not now! He's back.
That glass is tougher than anything.
Not tougher than crystallised carbon.
He used a diamond.
Oh, sinnerman, where you gonna run to? Sinnerman, where you gonna run to? Where you gonna run to? All on that day Well, I run to the rock Ready? Yes.
Stand back.
Stand back.
Mr Holmes.
Mr Holmes.

Oh, Lord Please help me, Lord Don't you see me praying Don't you see me down here praying But the Lord said Go to the devil The Lord said Go to the devil He said Go to the devil All on that day So I ran to the devil He was waiting Remember Yes.
Remember Yes.
Remember what they told you.
Don't try to be clever.
No.
Please, keep it simple and brief.
God forbid the star witness at the trial should appear intelligent.
Intelligent, fine.
Let's give "smart-arse" a wide berth.
I'll just be myself.
Are you listening to me(?) Today, outside the Old Bailey This is the trial of the century The trial of James Moriarty James Moriarty, earlier today accused of attempting to steal the Crown Jewels.
At the Old Bailey we have Reichenbach hero Sherlock Holmes Would you mind slipping your hand into my pocket? Thanks.
It was boiling, I ran to the sea It was boiling I ran to the sea Crown v Moriarty, please proceed to Court 10.
You're him.
Wrong toilet.
I'm a big fan.
Evidently.
I read your cases, follow them all.
Sign my shirt, would you? There are two types of fans.
Oh? Catch me before I kill again, Type A.
Uh-huh.
What's Type B? Your bedroom's just a taxi ride away.
Hmm.
Guess which one I am? Neither.
Really? No, you're not a fan at all.
Those marks on your forearm, edge of a desk.
You've been typing in a hurry, probably, pressure on, facing a deadline.
That all? There's an ink smudge on your wrist, a bulge in your jacket pocket.
Bit of a giveaway? The smudge is deliberate, to see if I'm as good as they say I am.
Hmm.
Oil-based, used in newspaper print.
But drawn on with an index finger, your finger.
Hmm.
Journalist.
Unlikely you get your hands dirty at the press.
You put that there to test me.
Wow! I'm liking you.
I'd make a great feature, "Sherlock Holmes, the man beneath the hat".
Kitty Riley.
Pleased to meet you.
I'm saving you the job of asking.
I won't give you an interview.
No, I don't want the money.
You and John Watson, just platonic? Can I put you down for a "no" there as well(?) There's all sorts of gossip in the press about you.
Sooner or later, you're going to need someone on your side.
Someone to set the record straight.
You think you're the girl for that job, do you? I'm smart and you can trust me totally.
Smart? OK, investigative journalist.
Good.
Well, look at me and tell me what you see.
If you're that skilful, you don't need an interview, you can just read what you need.
No? OK, my turn.
I see someone who's waiting for their first scoop, so their editor will notice them.
You're wearing an expensive skirt, that's been rehemmed twice.
Only posh skirt you've got.
Your nails, you can't afford to do them that often.
I see someone who's hungry, I don't see smart.
I don't see trustworthy.
I'll give you a quote.
if you like.
Three little words.
You repel me.
"A consulting criminal.
" Yes.
Your words.
Can you expand on that answer? James Moriarty is for hire.
A tradesman? Yes.
But not the sort who'd fix your heating? No, the sort who'd plant a bomb or stage an assassination.
But I'm sure he'd make a decent job of your boiler.
Would you describe him as Leading.
What? You're leading the witness.
He'll object and the judge'll uphold.
Mr Holmes.
Ask me how, HOW would I describe him? What opinion have I formed of him? Do they not teach you this? Mr Holmes, we are fine without your help.
HOW would you describe this man, his character? First mistake.
James Moriarty isn't a man at all.
He's a spider.
A spider at the centre of a web, a criminal web with a thousand threads and he knows precisely how each and every single one of them dances.
SHE CLEARS THROA And how long? No, no.
Don't, don't do that.
That's really not a good question.
Mr Holmes! How long have I known him? Not your best line of enquiry.
We met twice, five minutes in total.
I pulled a gun, he tried to blow me up.
I felt we had a special something.
Miss Sorrel, are you seriously claiming this man is an expert? After knowing the accused for just five minutes? Two minutes would have made me an expert, five was ample.
Mr Holmes, that's a matter for the jury.
Oh, really? One librarian, two teachers, two high-pressure jobs, probably the City.
The foreman's a medical secretary, trained abroad, judging by her shorthand.
Mr Holmes? Seven are married, two are having an affair with each other.
Oh, they've just had tea and biscuits.
Would you like to know who ate the wafer? Mr Holmes! You've been called here to answer Miss Sorrel's questions, not to give us a display of your intellectual prowess.
Keep your answers brief and to the point.
Anything else will be treated as contempt.
Do you think you could survive for just a few minutes WITHOUT SHOWING OFF?! CELL DOOR SLAMS What did I say? I said don't get clever.
I can't just turn it on and off like a tap.
Well? Well, what? You were there for the whole thing, up in the gallery, start to finish.
Like you said it would be sat on his backside, never even stirred.
Moriarty is not mounting any defence.
Bank of England, Tower of London, Pentonville.
Three of the most secure places in the country and six weeks ago, Moriarty breaks in, no-one knows how or why.
All we know is He ended up in custody.
Don't do that.
Do what? The look.
Look? You're doing the look again.
Well, I can't see it, can I? It's my face.
Yes and you're doing a "We both know what's really going on here" face.
We do.
No, I don't, which is why I find the face so annoying.
If Moriarty wanted the jewels, he'd have them.
If he wanted the prisoners freed, they'd be on the streets.
The reason he's still in a prison cell is because he chose to be there.
Somehow this is part of his scheme.
Mr Crayhill, can we have your first witness? Your Honour, we're not calling any witnesses.
I don't follow.
You've entered a plea of not guilty.
Nevertheless, my client is offering no evidence.
The defence rests.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, James Moriarty stands accused of several counts of attempted burglary.
Crimes which, if he's found guilty, will elicit a very long custodial sentence, and yet his legal team has chosen to offer no evidence whatsoever to support their plea.
I find myself in the unusual position of recommending a verdict wholeheartedly.
You must find him guilty.
Guilty.
You must find him guilty.
DOOR SLAMS They're coming back.
That's six minutes.
Surprised it took them that long, to be honest.
There's a queue for the loo! Have you reached a verdict on which you all agree? PHONE RINGS Not guilty, they found him not guilty.
No defence and Moriarty's walked free.
Sherlock? Are you listening? He's out, you know he'll be coming after you.
Sherl VIOLIN PLAYS STAIRS CREAK MUSIC STOPS VIOLIN PLAYS AGAIN DOOR CREAKS Most people knock.
But then, you're not most people, I suppose.
Kettle's just boiled.
Johann Sebastian would be appalled.
May I? Please.
You know when he was on his deathbed, Bach, he heard his son at the piano playing one of his pieces.
The boy stopped before he got to the end.
The dying man jumped out of bed, ran to the piano and finished it.
Couldn't cope with an unfinished melody.
Neither can you, that's why you've come.
Be honest, you're a tiny bit pleased.
What, with the verdict? With me, back on the streets.
Every fairy tale needs a good old-fashioned villain.
You need me or you're nothing.
Because we're just alike, you and I, except you're boring.
You're on the side of the angels.
You got to the jury, of course.
I got into the Tower of London, you think I can't worm my way into 12 hotel rooms? Cable network.
Every hotel bedroom has a personalised TV screen.
And every person has their pressure point.
Someone that they want to protect from harm.
Easy peasy.
So how are you going to do it? Burn me? Ah, that's the problem, the final problem.
Have you worked out what it is yet? What's the final problem? I did tell you but did you listen? How hard do you find it, having to say "I don't know"? I don't know.
Oh, that's clever, very clever, awfully clever.
Speaking of clever, have you told your little friends yet? Told them what? Why I broke into all those places and never took anything? No.
But you understand? Obviously.
Off you go, then.
Tell you what you already know? No, prove that you know it.
You didn't take anything because you don't need to.
Good.
You'll never need to take anything ever again.
Very good, because? Because nothing in the Bank of England, the Tower of London or Pentonville Prison could possibly match the value of the key that could get you into all three.
I can open any door anywhere with a few tiny lines of computer code.
No such thing as a private bank account now, they're all mine.
No such thing as secrecy, I OWN secrecy.
Nuclear codes? I could blow up NATO in alphabetical order.
In a world of locked rooms, the man with the key is king.
And honey, you should see me in a crown.
You were advertising all through the trial, you were showing the world what you can do.
And you were helping.
Big client list rogue governments, intelligence communities, terrorist cells.
They all want me.
Suddenly, I'm Mr Sex.
If you can break any bank, what do you care about the highest bidder? I don't, I just like to watch them all competing.
"Daddy loves me the best.
" Aren't ordinary people adorable? Well, you know, you've got John.
I should get myself a live-in one.
Why are you doing all of this? It must be so funny.
You don't want money or power, not really.
What is it all for? I want to solve the problem.
Our problem.
The final problem.
It's going to start very soon, Sherlock the fall.
HE WHISTLES But don't be scared, falling is just like flying, except there's a more permanent destination.
Never liked riddles.
Learn to.
Because I owe you a fall, Sherlock.
I owe you.
KEYPAD BLEEPS Er, excuse me, I'm looking for Mycroft Holmes? Would you happen to know if he's around at all? Can you not hear me? Yes, all right.
Anyone? Anyone at all know where Mycroft Holmes is, I've been asked to meet him here? No takers, right.
Am I invisible, can you actually see me? Ah, thanks, gents.
I've been asked to meet Mycroft Holmes.
What the hell?! MUFFLED CRIES FROM JOHN Tradition, John, our traditions define us.
So total silence is traditional, is it? You can't even say pass the sugar? Three-quarters of the diplomatic service and half the government front bench all sharing one tea trolley, it's for the best, believe me.
We don't want a repeat of 1972.
But we can talk in here.
You read this stuff? Caught my eye.
Mm-hm.
Saturday, they're doing a big expose.
I'd love to know where she got her information.
Someone called Brook.
Recognise the name? School friend, maybe? HE LAUGHS Of Sherlock's? But that's not why I asked you here.
Who's that? Don't know? No.
Never seen his face before? Um He's taken a flat in Baker Street, two doors down from you.
Hm, I was thinking of doing a drinks thing for the neighbours.
I'm not sure you'll want to.
Sulejmani, Albanian hit squad, expertly trained killer, living less than 20 feet from your front door.
Well, it's a great location.
Jubilee line's handy.
John What's it got to do with me? Dyachenko.
Ludmila.
Oh Actually, I think I have seen her.
Russian killer.
She's taken the flat opposite.
OK.
I'm sensing a pattern here.
In fact, four top international assassins relocate to within spitting distance of 221b.
Anything you'd care to share with me? JOHN LAUGHS I'm moving? It's not hard to guess the common denominator, is it? You think this is Moriarty? He promised Sherlock he'd come back.
If this was Moriarty, we'd be dead already.
If not Moriarty, then who? Why don't you talk to Sherlock, if you're so concerned about him? Oh, God, don't tell me.
Too much history between us, John.
Old scores, resentments.
Nicked all his Smurfs? Broke his Action Man? (Finished.
) We both know what's coming, John.
Moriarty is obsessed, he's sworn to destroy his only rival.
So you want me to watch out for your brother because he won't accept your help? If it's not too much trouble? DOOR BANGS Excuse me.
Sorry.
Sherlock, something weird What's going on? Kidnapping.
Rufus Bruhl.
The ambassador to the US.
He's in Washington, isn't he? Not him, his children.
Max and Claudette, age seven and nine.
They're at St Aldates.
Posh boarding place in Surrey.
School broke up, the boarders went home.
A few kids remained, including those two.
The kids have vanished.
The ambassador's asked for you personally.
The Reichenbach hero.
Isn't it great to be working with a celebrity? We shouldn't need to keep you for much longer.
Thank you.
It's all right.
Miss Mackenzie, House Mistress.
Go easy.
Miss Mackenzie, you're in charge of pupil welfare, yet you left this place wide open last night.
What are you, an idiot, a drunk or a criminal?! Quickly, tell me! All the doors and windows were properly bolted.
No-one, not even me, went into their room last night.
You have to believe me! I do, I just wanted you to speak quickly.
Miss Mackenzie will need to breath into a bag now.
SHE SOBS Six grand a term, you'd expect them to keep the kids safe for you.
You said the other kids had all left on their holidays.
They were the only two sleeping on this floor.
There's absolutely no sign of a break-in.
The intruder must have been hidden inside some place.
Show me where the brother slept.
The boy sleeps there every night.
Gazing at the only light source outside in the corridor.
He'd recognise every shape, every outline, the silhouette of everyone who came to the door.
OK, so? So if someone approaches the door who he doesn't recognise, an intruder, maybe he can even see the outline of a weapon.
What would he do? In the precious few seconds before they came into the room, how would he use them if not to cry out? This little boy, this particular little boy, who reads all of those spy books, what would he do? He'd leave a sign? HE SNIFFS Get Anderson! Linseed oil.
Not much use, it doesn't lead us to the kidnapper.
Brilliant, Anderson.
Really? Yes, brilliant impression of an idiot.
Floor.
He made a trail for us.
The boy was made to walk ahead of them.
On what, tiptoe? Indicates anxiety.
Gun held to his head.
The girl was pulled beside him, dragged sideways.
He had his left arm cradled about her neck.
That's the end of it, we don't know where they went from here.
Tells us nothing after all.
You're right, Anderson, nothing.
Except his shoe size, his height, his gait, his walking pace.
SHERLOCK LAUGHS Having fun? Starting to.
Maybe don't do the smiling.
Kidnapped children? How could he get past the CCTV? If all the doors were locked.
He walked in when they weren't locked.
But a stranger can't just walk into a school like that.
Anyone can walk in anywhere if they pick the right moment.
Yesterday, end of term, parents milling around, chauffeurs, staff.
What's one more stranger among that lot? He was waiting for them.
All he had to do was find a place to hide.
Molly! Hello, I'm just going out.
No, you're not.
I've got a lunch date.
Cancel it, have lunch with me.
What? I need your help.
One of your old boyfriends, we're tracking him down.
He's been naughty.
Moriarty? Of course it's Moriarty! Jim wasn't my boyfriend, we went out three times.
I ended it.
Then he stole the Crown Jewels, broke into the Bank of England and organised a prison break.
For the sake of law and order, I suggest you avoid all future attempts at a relationship, Molly.
Oil, John.
The oil in the kidnapper's footprint.
It'll lead us to Moriarty.
All the chemical traces on his shoe have been preserved.
The sole of the shoe is like a passport.
If we're lucky, we'll see everything he's been up to.
I need that analysis.
Alkaline.
Thank you, John.
Molly.
Yes.
I O U.
Glycerol molecule.
HE SIGHS What are you? What did you mean, IOU? You said IOU.
You were muttering it while you were working.
Nothing, mental note.
You're a bit like my dad.
He's dead.
No, sorry.
Molly, please don't feel the need to make conversation, it's really not your area.
When he was dying, he was always cheerful, he was lovely, except when he thought no-one could see.
I saw him once, he looked sad.
Molly.
You look sad, when you think he can't see you.
Are you OK? And don't just say you are, because I know what that means, looking sad when you think no-one can see you.
You can see me.
I don't count.
What I'm trying to say is, that if there's anything I can do, anything you need, anything at all, you can have me.
No, I just mean, I mean, if there's anything you need, it's fine.
But what can I need from you? Nothing.
I don't know.
You could probably say thank you, actually.
Thank you? I'm just going to go and get some crisps.
Do you want anything? It's OK, I know you don't.
Well, actually, maybe I'll I know you don't.
Sherlock? Hmm? This envelope that was in her trunk, there's another one.
What? On our doorstep.
Found it today.
Yes, and look at that.
Look at that, exactly the same seal.
Breadcrumbs.
Uh-huh.
It was there when I got back.
A little trace of breadcrumbs.
Hardback copy of Fairy Tales.
Two children led into the forest by a wicked father, follow a little trail of breadcrumbs.
That's Hansel and Gretel.
What sort of kidnapper leaves clues? The sort that likes to boast, that thinks it's a game.
He sat in our flat and he said these exact words to me "All fairy tales need a good old-fashioned villain.
" The fifth substance, it's part of the tale.
The witch's house.
What? The glycerol molecule.
PGPR! What's that? It's used in making chocolate.
This fax arrived an hour ago.
PHONE RINGS What have you got for us? We need to find a place in the city where all five of these things intersect.
Chalk, asphalt, brick dust, vegetation.
What chocolate?! I think we're looking for a disused sweet factory.
We need to narrow that down.
A sweet factory with asphalt? No, too general.
Something more specific.
Chalk, chalky clay.
That's a far thinner band of geology.
Brick dust? Building site.
Bricks from the 1950s.
There's thousands of building sites in London.
I've got people out looking.
So have I! Homeless network, faster than the police, far more relaxed about taking bribes.
PHONES RING John.
Rhododendron ponticum.
Matches.
Addlestone.
What? A mile of disused factories between the river and the park, matches everything.
Right, come on.
Come on! SIRENS BLARE OK, you look over there.
Look everywhere.
OK, spread out, please, spread out.
(Quietly, quietly!) This was alight moments ago.
They're still here! Sweet wrappers? What's he been feeding you? Hansel and Gretel.
HE SNIFFS Ugh! Mercury.
What? The papers, they're painted with mercury, lethal.
The more they ate It was killing them.
But it's not enough to kill them on its own.
Taken in large enough quantities, eventually it would kill them.
He didn't need to be there for the execution.
Murder by remote control, he could be 1,000 miles away.
The hungrier they got, the more they ate, the faster they died.
Neat.
Sherlock.
Over here! I've got him, don't worry.
Right then, the professionals are finished.
If the amateurs want to go in and have their turn.
Now remember, she's in shock and she's just seven years old, so, anything you can do to Not be myself? Yeah, might be helpful.
Claudette, I SHE SCREAMS No, no, I know it's been hard for you.
Claudette, listen to me.
Out.
Get out! Makes no sense.
Kid's traumatised.
Something about Sherlock reminds her of the kidnapper.
What's she said? Hasn't uttered another syllable.
And the boy? No, he's unconscious.
He's still in intensive care.
Don't let it get to you, I always feel like screaming when you walk into a room.
In fact, so do most people.
Come on.
SIREN BLARES OUTSIDE Brilliant work you did finding those kids from just a footprint, it's really amazing.
Thank you.
Unbelievable.
Ah.
You OK? Thinking.
This is my cab, you get the next one.
Why? You might talk.
'Is this chocolate?' 'We're looking for a disused sweet factory.
' 'Get out!' 'Aaaargh!' Problem? TV BLARES '.
.
this stunning evening wear set from us at London Taxi Shopping.
Can you turn this off, please? 'The set comprises of a beautiful ' Can you turn this off?! 'Accompanied by four spangly diamond bracelets ' Hello.
Are you ready for the story? This is the story of Sir Boast-a-lot.
A footprint, it's all he had.
A footprint.
Yeah, well, you know what he's like.
CSI Baker Street.
Well, our boys couldn't have done it.
Well, that's why we need him, he's better.
That's one explanation.
And what's the other? Sir Boast-a-lot was the bravest and cleverest knight at the round table.
But soon the other knights began to grow tired of his stories about how brave he was and how many dragons he'd slain.
And soon they began to wonder, "Are Sir Boast-a-lot's stories even true?" Only he could have found that evidence.
Oh, no.
The girl screams her head off when she sees him a man she has never seen before, unless she had seen him before.
What's your point? You know what it is, you just don't want to think about it.
So, all of the knights went to King Arthur and said, "I don't believe Sir Boast-a-lot's stories.
"He's just a big old liar who makes things up to make himself look good.
" SHE MOUTHS You're not seriously suggesting he's involved, are you? We have to entertain the possibility.
And then, even the King began to wonder.
But that wasn't the end of Sir Boast-a-lot's problem.
No.
That wasn't the final problem.
The end.
Stop the cab.
Stop the cab! What was that?! What was that? No charge.
Watch out! TYRES SQUEAL Thank you.
GUNFIRE Sherlock! That is him.
It's him.
Sulejmani or something, Mycroft showed me his file.
He's a big Albanian gangster, lives two doors down from us.
He died because I shook his hand.
What? He saved my life, but he couldn't touch me.
Why? Four assassins living right on our doorstep.
They haven't come here to kill me.
They have to keep me alive.
I've got something that all of them want.
But if one of them approaches me The others kill them before they can get it.
All of the attention is focused on me.
There's a surveillance web closing in on us right now.
So what have you got that's so important? I need to ask about the dusting.
Precise details, in the last week, what's been cleaned? Tuesday, I did your lino.
No, this room, this is where we'll find it.
Any break in the dust line.
You can put back anything but dust.
Dust is eloquent.
(What's he on about?) Cameras, we're being watched.
What?! Cameras? Here? DOORBELL RINGS I'm in my nightie! FOOTSTEPS ON STAIRS No, Inspector.
Why? The answer's no.
You've not heard the question! You want to take me to the station.
Saving you the trouble of asking.
Sherlock.
The scream? Yeah.
Who was it? Donovan? I bet it was Donovan.
"Am I somehow responsible for the kidnapping?" Ha ha, Moriarty is smart.
He planted that doubt in her head.
That little nagging sensation.
You're going to have to be strong to resist.
You can't kill an idea, can you? Not once it's made a home there.
Will you come? One photograph, that's his next move.
Moriarty's game.
First the scream, then a photograph of me being taken in for questioning.
He wants to destroy me inch by inch.
It is a game, Lestrade, and not one I'm willing to play.
Give my regards to Sergeant Donovan.
COMPUTER BLEEPS They'll be deciding.
Deciding? Whether to come back with a warrant and arrest me.
You think? Standard procedure.
You should have gone with him.
People'll think I don't care what people think.
You'd care if they thought you were stupid or wrong.
No, that would just make them stupid or wrong.
Sherlock, I don't want the world believing you're That I am what? A fraud.
You're worried they're right.
What? That they're right about me.
No.
That's why you're upset.
You can't entertain the possibility they may be right.
You're afraid you've been taken in.
I'm not.
Moriarty is playing with your mind, too.
Can't you SEE what's going on?! No, I know you for real.
100 percent? Well, nobody could fake being such an annoying dick all the time.
Sherlock Holmes? Yes, sir.
That bloke that's been in the press? Mm-hm.
I thought he was some sort of private eye.
He is.
We've been consulting with him, that's what you're telling me? Not used him on any proper cases though, have we? Well, one or two.
Or 20 or 30.
What?! I'm not the only senior officer who did this.
Gregson Shut up! An amateur detective given access to all sorts of classified information.
And now he's a suspect in a case.
With all due respect You're a bloody idiot, Lestrade! Now go and fetch him in, right now.
Do it! Proud of yourselves? Well, what if it's not just this case? What if he's done this to us every single time? PHONE BLEEPS So, still got some friends on the force.
It's Lestrade.
Says they're all coming over here now.
Queuing up to slap on the handcuffs.
Every officer you've ever made feel like a tit, which is a lot of people.
Yoo-hoo.
Oh, sorry, am I interrupting? Some chap delivered a parcel, I forgot, marked perishable.
I had to sign for it.
Funny name, German, like the fairy tales.
SIRENS BLARE Burnt to a crisp.
What does it mean? DOORBELL RINGS KNOCKING AT DOOR 'Police!' I'll go.
'Sherlock.
'Excuse me, Mrs Hudson.
We need to talk to you.
'You can't just barge in like that!' JOHN: 'Have you got a warrant? Have you?' LESTRADE: 'Leave it, John.
'Eh? Manners!' Sherlock Holmes, I'm arresting you on suspicion of abduction and kidnapping.
It's OK, John.
He's not resisting.
No, it's not all right, this is ridiculous.
Get him downstairs now.
You don't have to do this.
Don't try to interfere or I shall arrest you too.
You done? I said it.
Hmm? First time we met.
Don't bother.
Solving crimes won't be enough.
One day he'll cross the line.
Now ask yourself, what sort of man would kidnap those kids just so he can impress us all by finding them? Donovan? Sir? Got our man? Er, yes, sir.
Looked a bit of a weirdo, if you ask me.
Often are, these vigilante types.
What are you looking at? Are you all right, sir? Joining me? Yeah.
Well, apparently it's against the law to chin the Chief Superintendent.
Hmm.
Bit awkward this.
There's no-one to bail us.
I was thinking more about our imminent and daring escape.
'All units to 27.
' What? 'All units to 2 ' ALARM SOUNDS Aah! Ladies and gentlemen, will you all please get on your knees? GUNFIRE NOW would be good! Do as he says! Just so you're aware, the gun is his idea, I'm just a you know.
My hostage.
Hostage, yes, that works.
That works.
So what now? Doing what Moriarty wants, becoming a fugitive.
Run! Get after him, Lestrade! Take my hand.
SIRENS BLARE Now people will definitely talk.
The gun! Leave it! Sherlock, wait! We're going to need to coordinate.
Go to your right.
Huh? Go to your right.
SIREN BLARES Everybody wants to believe it, that's what makes it so clever.
A lie that's preferable to the truth.
My deductions were a sham.
No-one feels inadequate, Sherlock's an ordinary man.
Mycroft, he could help us.
Big family reconciliation, now's not really the moment.
Sherlock we're being followed.
I knew we couldn't outrun the police.
That's not the police, it's one of my new neighbours from Baker Street.
Let's see if he can give us some answers.
(Where are we going?) We're going to jump in front of that bus.
BOTH: Oof! BUS BLASTS HORN Oh Tell me what you want from me.
Tell me! He left it at your flat.
Who? Moriarty.
What? The computer key code.
Of course.
He's selling it.
The programme he used to break into the Tower.
He planted it when he came around.
GUNFIRE SIREN BLARES THEY PAN It's a game-changer.
It's a key, it can break into any system and it's sitting in our flat right now.
That's why he left that message, telling everyone where to come, "Get Sherlock!" We need to get back into the flat and search.
CID will be camped out.
Why plant it on you? It's another subtle way of smearing my name, now I'm best pals with all those criminals.
Yeah, well, have you seen this? A kiss-and-tell.
Some bloke called Rich Brook.
Who is he? ALARM BLEEPS Too late to go on the record? Congratulations, "The Truth About Sherlock Holmes.
" The scoop that everybody wanted and you got it.
Bravo! I gave you your opportunity.
I wanted to be on your side, remember? You turned me down, so Then lo and behold, someone spills all the beans.
How utterly convenient.
Who is Brook? Oh, come on, Kitty, no-one trusts the voice at the end of a phone.
All those little meetings in cafes, those sessions in the hotel room when he gabbled into your Dictaphone.
How do you know that you can trust him? A man turns up with the Holy Grail in his pockets.
What were his credentials? Darling, they didn't have any ground coffee, so I just got normal.
You said that they wouldn't find me here, you said that I'd be safe here.
You are safe.
Richard, I'm a witness, they wouldn't harm you in front of witnesses.
So that's your source? Moriarty is Richard Brook? Of course he's Richard Brook, there is no Moriarty.
There never has been.
What are you talking about? Look him up.
Rich Brook, an actor Sherlock Holmes hired to be Moriarty.
Dr Watson, I know you're a good man, don't, don't, don't hurt me.
No, you are Moriarty! He's Moriarty! We've met, remember? You were going to blow me up! I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
He paid me, I needed the work.
I'm an actor, I was out of work.
Sherlock, you'd better explain, because I am not getting this.
I'll be doing the explaining, in print.
It's all here, conclusive proof.
You invented James Moriarty, your nemesis.
Invented him?! Mm-hm.
He invented all the crimes, actually.
And to cap it all, he made up a master villain.
Don't be ridiculous! Ask him.
He's right here.
Just ask him.
Tell him, Richard.
For God's sake, this man was on trial! Yes, and you paid him to take the rap.
Promised you'd rig the jury.
Not exactly a West End role, but I'll bet the money was good.
But not so good he didn't want to sell his story.
I am sorry.
I am.
I am sorry.
So this is the story you're going to publish? The big conclusion of it all, Moriarty's an actor? He knows I am.
I have proof.
Show them Kitty, show them something.
Yeah, show me something.
I'm on TV.
I'm on kids' TV.
I'm the story-teller.
I'm the story-teller.
It's on DVD.
Just tell him.
It's all coming out.
It's all over.
Just tell them.
Just tell them.
Tell them! It's all over now! No! Don't you touch me! Don't you lay a finger on me! Stop it now! Don't hurt me! Don't let him get away! Leave him alone! No, no, no.
He'll have back-up.
Do you know what, Sherlock Holmes? I look at you know and I can read you and you repel me.
Can he do that? Completely change his identity, make you the criminal? He's got my whole life story.
That's what you do when you sell a big lie, you wrap it up in the truth to make it more palatable.
It'll be your word against his.
He's been sowing doubt into people's minds for 24 hours.
There's only one thing he needs to do to complete his game and that Sherlock? There's something I need to do.
What? Can I help? No, on my own.
You're wrong, you know? You do count.
You've always counted and I've always trusted you.
But you were right.
I'm not OK.
Tell me what's wrong.
Molly, I think I'm going to die.
What do you need? If I wasn't everything that you think I am, everything that I think I am would you still want to help me? What do you need? You.
She has really done her homework, Miss Riley, and it's things that only someone close to Sherlock could know.
Ah.
Have you seen your brother's address book lately? Two names yours and mine and Moriarty didn't get this stuff from me.
John So how does it work, your relationship? Do you go out for a coffee now and then, you and Jim? Your own brother and you blabbed about his entire life to this maniac.
I never intend I never dreamt This this is what you were trying to tell me, isn't it? "Watch his back because I've made a mistake.
" How did you meet him? People like him, we know about them, we watch them.
But James Moriarty the most dangerous criminal mind the world has ever seen, and, in his pocket, the ultimate weapon.
The key code.
A few lines of computer code that can unlock any door.
And you abducted him to try and find the key code? Interrogated him for weeks.
And? He wouldn't play along.
He just sat there staring into the darkness.
The only thing that made him open up I could get him to talk, just a little.
But In return you had to offer him Sherlock's life story.
So, one big lie Sherlock's a fraud, and people will swallow it because the rest of it's true.
Moriarty wanted Sherlock destroyed, right, and you have given him the perfect ammunition.
John.
I'm sorry.
Oh, please! Tell him, would you? I got your message.
The computer code is the key to this.
We find it, we can use it.
Use it? He used it to create a false identity so we can break into the records and destroy Richard Brook.
Bring back Jim Moriarty again.
Somewhere in 221b, somewhere on the day of the verdict he left it hidden.
Uh-huh.
What did he touch? An apple, nothing else.
Did he write anything down? No.
MOBILE RINGS Oh.
Yeah, speaking.
What? What happened? Is she OK? Oh, my God! Right, yes, I'm coming.
What is it? Paramedics.
Mrs Hudson's been shot.
How? Probably one of the killers you managed to attract.
Jesus! She's dying, Sherlock.
Let's go.
You go.
I'm busy.
Busy?! Thinking.
I need to think.
You need to? Doesn't she mean anything to you? You once half-killed a man because he laid a finger on her.
She's my landlady.
She's dying you machine! Sod this.
Sod this! You stay here if you want, on your own.
Alone is what I have.
Alone protects me.
No, friends protect people.
TEXT ALER I've been kicked around since I was born But now it's all right, it's OK You can look the other way We can try to understand The New York Times' effect on man Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother You're stayin' alive Well here we are at last.
You and me, Sherlock.
And our problem the final problem.
Staying alive! It's so boring, isn't it? It's just staying.
All my life I've been searching for distractions and you were the best distraction and now I don't even have you because I've beaten you.
And you know what? In the end, it was easy.
It was easy.
Now I've got to go back to playing with the ordinary people, and it turns out you're ordinary, just like all of them.
Ah, well.
Did you almost start to wonder if I was real? Did I nearly get you? Richard Brook.
Nobody seems to get the joke, but you do.
Of course.
Attaboy.
Richard Brook in German is Reichenbach.
The case that made my name.
Just trying to have some fun.
Good.
You got that too.
Beats like digits.
Every beat is a one, every rest is a zero.
Binary code.
That's why all those assassins tried to save my life.
It was hidden on me, hidden inside my head.
A few simple lines of computer code that can break into any system.
Told all my clients, last one to Sherlock is a sissy.
But now that it's up here, I can use it to alter all the records.
I can kill Rich Brook and bring back Jim Moriarty.
No, no, no, no, no.
This is too easy.
This is too easy.
There is no key, doofus! Those digits are meaningless.
They're utterly meaningless.
You don't really think a couple of lines of computer code are going to crash the world around our ears? I'm disappointed in you, ordinary Sherlock.
But the rhythm Partita no 1! Thank you, Johann Sebastian Bach.
But then how did you ? How did I break into the bank, to the Tower, to the prison? Daylight robbery! All it takes is some willing participants.
I knew you'd fall for it.
That's your weakness.
You always want everything to be clever.
Shall we finish the game? One final act.
Glad you chose a tall building.
Nice way to do it.
Do it? Do what? Yes, of course.
My suicide.
Genius detective proved to be a fraud.
I read it in the paper so it must be true.
I love newspapers.
Fairy tales.
And pretty grim ones too.
Oh, God, John, you made me jump.
Is everything OK with the police? Has Sherlock sorted it all out? Oh, my God.
Taxi! Taxi! No, no, no.
Police sort of! Thanks, mate.
Thanks a lot! I can prove that you created an entirely false identity.
Oh, just kill yourself.
It's a lot less effort.
Go on.
For me.
Please! You're insane.
You're just getting that now? Wo-wo-wo! OK.
Let me give you a little extra incentive.
Your friends will die if you don't.
John? Not just John.
Everyone.
Mrs Hudson? Everyone.
Lestrade? Three bullets, three gunmen, three victims.
There's no stopping them now unless my people see you jump.
You can have me arrested, you can torture me, you can do anything you like with me, but nothing's going to prevent them from pulling the trigger.
Your only three friends in the world will die unless Unless I kill myself and complete your story.
You've got to admit, that's sexier.
And I die in disgrace.
Of course.
That's the point of this.
Oh.
You've got an audience now.
Off you pop.
Go on.
I told you how this ends.
Your death is the only thing that's going to call off the killers.
I'm certainly not going to do it.
Would you give me one moment, please? One moment of privacy.
Please.
Of course.
HE LAUGHS What?! What is it? What did I miss? You're not going to do it.
So the killers can be called off, then there's a recall code or a word or a number.
I don't have to die if I've got you.
Oh! You think you can make me stop the order? You think you can make me do that? Yes.
So do you.
Sherlock, your big brother and all the King's horses couldn't make me do a thing I didn't want to.
Yes, but I'm not my brother, remember? I am you.
Prepared to do anything.
Prepared to burn.
Prepared to do what ordinary people won't do.
You want me to shake hands with you in hell? I shall not disappoint you.
Nah.
You talk big.
Nah.
You're ordinary.
You're ordinary.
You're on the side of the angels.
Oh, I may be on the side of the angels, but don't think for one second that I am one of them.
No you're not.
I see.
You're not ordinary.
No.
You're me.
You're me.
Thank you Sherlock Holmes.
Thank you.
Bless you.
As long as I'm alive, you can save your friends, you've got a way out.
Well, good luck with that.
No.
Yes, sir.
Thank you.
Bye.
MOBILE DIAL TONE MOBILE RINGS Hello? John.
Hey, Sherlock.
Are you OK? Turn around and walk back the way you came.
I'm coming in.
Just do as I ask! Please.
Where? Stop there.
Sherlock? OK, look up.
I'm on the rooftop.
Oh, God.
I I can't come down, so we'll just have to do it like this.
What's going on? An apology.
It's all true.
What? Everything they said about me.
I invented Moriarty.
Why are you saying this? I'm a fake.
Sherlock The newspapers were right all along.
I want you to tell Lestrade, I want you to tell Mrs Hudson and Molly.
In fact, tell anyone who will listen to you that I created Moriarty for my own purposes.
OK, shut up Sherlock.
Shut up.
The first time we met the first time we met, you knew all about my sister, right? Nobody could be that clever.
You could.
I researched you.
Before we met, I discovered everything that I could to impress you.
It's a trick.
Just a magic trick.
No.
All right, stop it now.
No.
Stay exactly where you are.
Don't move.
All right.
Keep your eyes fixed on me.
Please, will you do this for me? Do what? This phone call, it's it's my note.
It's what people do, don't they? Leave a note? Leave a note when? Goodbye, John.
No.
Don't Sherlock! Sherlock.
Sherlock Sherlock.
I'm a doctor, let me come through.
Let me come through, please.
He's my friend.
He's my friend Please.
Please, let me just Oh, Jesus! No.
God, no.
There's stuff that you wanted to say but didn't say it.
Yeah.
Say it now.
Sorry, I can't.
There's all the stuff.
All the science equipment.
I left it all in boxes.
I don't know what needs doing.
I thought I'd take it to a school.
Would you? I can't go back to the flat again, not at the moment.
I'm angry.
It's OK, John.
There's nothing unusual in that.
That's the way he made everyone feel.
All the marks on my table and the noise, firing guns at half past one in the morning Yeah.
Bloody specimens in my fridge.
Imagine, keeping bodies where there's food.
Yes.
And the fighting! Drove me up the wall with all his carryings-on.
Listen, I'm not actually that angry, OK? OK.
I'll leave you alone to, you know Erm Hmm.
You you told me once that you weren't a hero.
Erm, there were times I didn't even think you were human, but let me tell you this, you were the best man the most human human being that I've ever known and no-one will ever convince me that you told me a lie, so there.
I was so alone and I owe you so much.
But, please, there's just one more thing, one more thing, one more miracle, Sherlock, for me, don't be dead.
Would you do that just for me? Just stop it.
Stop this.
You bastard! A breakaway sect of Buddhist warrior monks infiltrated by a blonde drug smuggler?! That never really happened.
A blonde drug smuggler who was exposed by an abbot with unusual powers of observation and deduction.
A blonde woman hiding amongst bald monks?! That wouldn't exactly take Sherlock Holmes.
Well, perhaps it did.
He's dead.
I'm sorry, I wish he wasn't, but he really is dead and gone.
Well, how do you explain this? Sighting number two.
Incident at New Delhi.
You haven't be titling these?! After that, it was simply a matter of tracking down the killer.
Which I did by working out the depth to which the chocolate flake had sunk into the victim's ice cream cone.
My friend will you not take any of the credit? This was all down to you.
Clever man, Inspector Prakesh.
Oh, what police inspector could have made that deduction?! Oh, thank you! You remember how Sherlock never took the credit when he solved all of your cases? - He didn't solve all of my cases.
- He's out there.
He's hiding, but he can't stop himself from getting involved.
It's so obviously him, if you know how to spot the signs.
Klein Brothers, the Towerhouse thing, the Kensington Ripper - solved all those myself.
Well, you got Towerhouse wrong.
No, I didn't! Yeah, you did.
Okay, sighting number three.
The Mysterious Juror.
'It had to be him.
' There's no-one else it can be, do you not see? I see that you lost a good job fantasising about a dead man coming back to life.
And I know why you want that to happen .
.
but it's never going to.
Okay .
.
I want to go and see an old friend.
You take care, okay? I'll put a word in, see if they won't review your case.
Just look at the map, though.
He's getting closer.
It's like he's coming back.
Well, it's good to see you, Greg.
- And you.
- Have a seat.
So, how have you been? Er, yeah, good.
Yeah.
Much better.
- So what's in the? - Oh, that? Yeah, that's um that's some stuff from my office, some stuff of Sherlock's, actually.
I probably should have thrown it out, but I didn't know if No, fine, yeah.
Yeah, there's there's something here, um I wasn't sure whether I should have kept it in.
You remember the video message he made for your birthday? I had to practically threaten him.
This is the uncut version.
It's quite funny.
Oh, right.
- Maybe I shouldn't have brought it.
- Don't worry, it's okay.
Probably won't even watch it.
Was that supposed to happen? The light going down? Yeah, okay.
Oh, er, hm, so what do I what do you want me to do at the end? Shall I, um, smile and wink? I do that sometimes.
I've no idea why.
People seem to like it.
It humanises me.
It's fine, whatever.
- Why am I doing this again? - You're going to miss the dinner.
Of course I'm going to miss dinner, there'll be people.
How could John be having a birthday dinner? All his friends hate him.
You only have to look at their faces.
I wrote an essay on suppressed hatred in close proximity, based entirely on his friends.
On reflection, it probably wasn't a very good choice of gift.
- What was my excuse again? - You said you had a thing.
Oh, right, yes, that's right, a thing.
You might want to elaborate.
No, no, no.
Only lies have detail.
Right, I just I need a moment to figure out what I'm going to do.
I can tell you what you can do.
You can stop being dead.
Okay.
Okay, I'm ready now.
Hello, John.
I'm sorry I'm not there at the moment, I'm very busy.
However, many happy returns.
Oh and don't worry, I'm going to be with you again very soon.
He's coming back.
'Sherlock!' 'It's a trick.
' Just a magic trick.
No.
All right, stop it now.
'Now, stay exactly where you are.
'Don't move.
' All right.
Keep your eyes fixed on me.
'Please, would you do this for me?' Do what? 'This phone call, it's er' .
.
it's my note.
It's what people do, don't they? 'Leave a note.
' Leave a note when? 'Goodbye, John.
' No.
Don't Sherlock! John.
John, look at me.
Look at me.
And sleep.
Right the way down, right the way deep, right the way, sound asleep.
That's real.
That's good, with my voice just there in the centre of your head and floating all the way around you.
And you will awaken in three, two, one .
.
zero.
Let me come through please! He's my friend.
'Bollocks!' No, no, no, no, it's obvious.
That's how he did it.
It's obvious.
Derren Brown?! Let it go, Sherlock's dead.
But is he? There was a body, it was him.
It was definitely him, Molly Hooper laid him out.
No, she's lying.
It was Jim Moriarty's body with a mask on.
A mask? A bungee rope, a mask, Derren Brown.
Two years and the theories keep getting more stupid.
How many more have you got for me today? Well, you know the paving slabs in that whole area, even the exact ones that he landed on, you know they were all Guilt! That's all this is.
You pushed us all into thinking that Sherlock that was a fraud, you and Donovan.
You did this and it killed him and he's staying dead.
Do you honestly believe that if you have enough stupid theories, it's going to change what really happened? I believe in Sherlock Holmes.
Yeah, well, that won't bring him back.
And that after extensive police investigations Richard Brook did indeed prove to be the creation of James Moriarty 'Amidst unprecedented scenes, there was uproar in court 'as Sherlock Holmes was vindicated and cleared of all suspicion.
' 'Sadly, all this comes too late for the detective, 'who became something of a celebrity two years ago.
' Questions are now being asked as to why police let matters get so far.
Sherlock Holmes fell to his death from the top of London's Bart's Hospital.
Although he left no note, friends say it's unlikely he was able to cope with the Well then.
Absent friends.
Sherlock.
Sherlock.
And may God rest his soul.
TRANSLATED FROM SERBIAN: What? Now listen to me.
There's an underground terrorist network active in London and a massive attack is imminent.
Sorry, but the holiday is over .
.
Brother dear.
Back to Baker Street .
.
Sherlock Holmes.
Penny for the guy? Oi, mate, penny for the guy? Penny for the guy, mate? Penny for the guy? Penny for the guy? Penny for the guy? 'That was the most ridiculous thing I've ever done.
' 'You invaded Afghanistan.
' You have been busy, haven't you? Quite the busy little bee.
Hmm.
Moriarty's network.
Took me two years to dismantle it.
And you're confident you have? The Serbian side was the last piece of the puzzle.
Yes.
You got yourself in deep there with Baron Maupertuis.
Quite a scheme.
Colossal.
Anyway.
You're safe now.
Mmm.
A small "thank you" wouldn't go amiss.
What for? For wading in.
In case you've forgotten, field work is not my natural milieu.
"Wading in?" You sat there and watched me being beaten a pulp.
I got you out.
No, I got me out.
Why didn't you intervene sooner? I couldn't risk giving myself away, could I? It would have ruined everything.
You were enjoying it.
Nonsense.
Definitely enjoying it.
Listen, do you have any idea what it was like, Sherlock, going undercover? Smuggling my way into their ranks like that? The noise, the people! I didn't know you spoke Serbian.
I didn't.
But the language has a Slavic root.
Frequent Turkish and German loan words.
Took me a couple of hours.
Hmm, you're slipping.
Middle-age, brother mine.
Comes to us all.
Oh, no, you don't take it, do you? No.
You forget a little thing like that.
Yes.
You forget lots of little things, it seems.
Uh-huh.
Not sure about that.
Hmm? Ages you.
Just trying it out.
Well, it ages you.
Look I'm not your mother, I've no right to expect it No But just one phone call, John! Just one phone call would have done.
I know.
After all we went through! Yes.
I am sorry.
Look, I understand how difficult it was for you after .
.
after I just let it slide, Mrs Hudson, I let it all slide.
And it just got harder and harder to pick up the phone, somehow.
Do you know what I mean? I need you to give this matter your full attention, Sherlock, is that quite clear? What do you think of this shirt? Sherlock! I will find your underground terror cell, Mycroft.
Just put me back in London.
I need to get to know the place again, breathe it in.
Feel every quiver of its beating heart.
One of our men died getting this information.
All the chatter, all the traffic concurs, there's going to be a terrorist strike on London, a big one.
And what about John Watson? John? Mm.
Have you seen him? Oh, yes, we meet up every Friday for fish and chips(!) I've kept a weather eye on him, of course.
We haven't been in touch at all toprepare him.
No.
Well, we'll have to get rid of that.
"We?" He looks ancient.
I can't be seen to be wandering around with an old man.
I couldn't face letting it out.
He never liked me dusting.
No, I know.
So why now? What changed your mind? Well, I've got some news.
Oh, God, is it serious? What? No, no, I'm not ill.
I've, well, I'm .
.
moving on.
You're emigrating? Nope.
Er, no, I've er .
.
I have met someone.
Oh! Ah, lovely.
Yeah.
We're getting married.
Well, I'm going to ask, anyway.
So soon after Sherlock? Hmm, well, yes.
What's his name? It's a woman.
A woman?! Yes, of course it's a woman.
You really have moved on, haven't you? Mrs Hudson, how many times? Sherlock was not my boyfriend! Live and let live, that's my motto.
Listen to me - I am not gay! I think I'll surprise John.
He'll be delighted.
You think so? Mm, pop into Baker Street, who knows, jump out of a cake.
Baker Street? He isn't there any more.
Why would he be? It's been two years.
He's got on with his life.
What life? I've been away.
Where's he going to be tonight? How would I know? You always know.
He has a dinner reservation in the Marylebone Road.
Nice little spot.
They have a few bottles of the 2000 Saint-Emilion, though I prefer the 2001.
I think maybe I'll just drop by.
You know, it is just possible that you won't be welcome.
No, it isn't.
Now, where is it? Where's what? You know what.
Welcome back, Mr Holmes.
Thank you.
Blud.
Sir, can I help you? Your wife just texted you, possibly her contractions have started.
Excuse me, sir.
Oh, sir, I am so, so sorry.
Er, please, let me just go to the kitchen and dry that off for you.
Finished with that, sir? Allow me to take it for you.
Madam, can I suggest you look at this menu, it's completely identical.
Can I help you with anything, sir? Hi, yeah, I'm looking for a bottle of champagne.
A good one.
Hmm, well, these are all excellent vintages, sir.
Oh, it's not really my area, what do you suggest? Well, you cannot possibly go wrong, but if you'd like my personal recommendation Hmm? This last one on the list is a favourite of mine.
It is, you might in fact say, like a face from the past.
Great.
I'll have that one please.
It is familiar, but with the quality of surprise! Well, surprise me.
I'm certainly endeavouring to, sir.
Sorry that took so long.
You OK? Yeah, yeah.
Me? Fine.
I am fine.
Now then, what did you want to ask me? More wine? No, I'm good with water, thanks.
Right.
So? Er, so Mary Listen, um I know it hasn't been long, and I know we haven't known each other for a long time Go on.
Yes, I will.
As you know, these last couple of years haven't been easy for me.
And meeting you Yeah, meeting you has been the best thing that could have possibly happened.
I agree.
What? I agree, I'm the best thing that could have happened to you.
Sorry.
Well, no, it's, um So .
.
if you'll have me, Mary, could you see your way, um If you could see your way to Sir, you'll find this vintage exceptionally to your liking.
It has all the qualities of the old, with the colour of the new.
No, sorry, not now, please.
Like a gaze from a crowd of strangers, suddenly one is aware of staring into the face of an old friend.
No, look, seriously, could you just? Interesting thing, a tuxedo.
Lends distinction to friends and anonymity to waiters.
John? John, what is it? What? Well, the short version .
.
not dead.
Bit mean springing it on you like that, I know.
Could have given you a heart attack, probably still will.
But in my defence, it was very funny.
OK, it's not a great defence.
Oh, no, you're Oh, yes.
Oh, my God! Not quite.
You died, you jumped off a roof.
No.
You're dead.
No, I'm quite sure, I checked.
Excuse me.
Doesdoes yours rub off too? Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Do you have any idea what you've done?! OK, John, I'm suddenly realising I probably owe you some sort of an apology All right, just, John, just keep Two years.
Two years! Hmm? I thought I thought .
.
you were dead.
Hmm? Now, you let me grieve.
Hmm.
How could you do that? How?! Wait, before you do anything that you might regret, um, one question, just let me ask one question.
Are you really going to keep that? I calculated that there were 13 possibilities once I'd invited Moriarty onto the roof.
'I wanted to avoid dying, if at all possible.
'The first scenario involved hurling myself into a parked van filled with washing bags.
'Impossible, the angle was too steep.
Secondly, a system of Japanese wrestling 'You know, for a genius, you can be remarkably thick.
' What? I don't care how you faked it, Sherlock.
I want to know why.
Why? Because Moriarty had to be stopped.
Oh.
Why, as in? I see.
Yes.
Why? That's a little more difficult to explain.
I've got all night.
Actually, um, that was mostly Mycroft's idea.
Oh, so it was your brother's plan? Oh, but he would have needed a confidante.
Mm-hm.
Sorry.
But he was the only one? The only one who knew? A couple of others.
It was a very elaborate plan, it had to be.
The next of the 13 possibilities was Who else? Who else knew? Who?! Molly.
Molly?! John Molly Hooper and some of my homeless network and that's all.
OK.
OK.
So just your brother, Molly Hooper and 100 tramps.
Ha, no! 25 at most.
Seriously, it's not a joke? You're really keeping this? Er, yeah.
Sure? Mary likes it.
Hmm, no, she doesn't.
She does.
She doesn't.
Oh, don't.
Oh, brilliant(!) Look, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't know how to tell you Right, no, no, this is charming.
I've really missed this(!) One word, Sherlock, that is all I would have needed! One word to let me know that you were alive! I've nearly been in contact so many times, but I worried that, you know, you might say something indiscreet.
What? You know, let the cat out of the bag.
So this is my fault! Oh, God! Why am I the only one who thinks that this is wrong?! The only one reacting like a human being! Over-reacting.
Over-reacting! John! Over-reacting! So you fake your own death and you waltz in here large as bloody life! Shh.
But I'm not meant to have a problem with it, cos Sherlock Holmes thinks it's a perfectly OK thing to do! Shut up! I don't want everyone knowing I'm still alive! Oh, so it's still a secret, is it?! Yes, it's still a secret! Promise you won't tell anyone? Swear to God! London is in danger, John.
There's an imminent terrorist attack and I need your help.
My help? You have missed this, admit it.
The thrill of the chase, the blood pumping through your veins, just the two of us against the rest of the world.
I don't understand, I said I'm sorry, isn't that what you're supposed to do? Gosh, you don't know anything about human nature, do you? Hmm, nature? No.
Human? No.
I'll talk him round.
You will? Oh, yeah.
Mary.
Can you believe his nerve? I like him.
What? I like him.
Those things will kill you.
Oh, you bastard! It's time to come back.
You've been letting things slide, Graham.
Greg.

'No.
' Sherlock! Oh, ho! What?! Are you out of your mind?! I don't see why not.
It's just as plausible as some of your theories.
Look, if you're not going to take it seriously, Laura I do take it seriously.
I don't think we should wear hats.
I founded 'The Empty Hearse' so like-minded people could meet, discuss theories! Sherlock's still out there.
I'm convinced of it.
Oh, my God! OhmyGod! "His movements were so silent, "so furtive he reminded me "of a trained bloodhound picking out a scent.
" You what? "I couldn't help thinking what an amazing criminal he'd make "if he turned his talents against the law.
" Don't read that.
Famous blog, finally.
Come on, that's Ancient history, yes, I know, but it's not though, is it, because he's What are you doing? Having a wash.
You're shaving it off.
Well, you hate it.
Sherlock hates it.
Apparently everyone hates it.
Oh! Are you going to see him again? No, I'm going to work.
Oh, and after work, are you going to see him again? No.
God, I had six months of bristly kisses for me and then his nibs turns up I don't shave for Sherlock Holmes.
You should put that on a T-shirt.
Shut up.
Or what? Or I'll marry you.
London, it's like a great cesspool into which all kinds of criminals, agents and drifters are irresistibly drained.
Sometimes it's not a question of who, it's a question of who knows? If this man cancels his papers, I need to know.
If this woman leaves London without putting her dog into kennels, I need to know.
I have certain people, they are markers.
If they start to move, I'll know something's up.
Like rats deserting a sinking ship.
All very interesting, Sherlock, but the terror alert has been raised to critical.
Boring.
Your move.
We have solid information, an attack IS coming.
Solid information, a secret terrorist organisation is planning an attack That's what secret terrorist organisations do, isn't it? It's their version of golf.
An agent gave his life to tell us that.
Oh, well, perhaps he shouldn't have done.
He was obviously just trying to show off.
None of these 'markers' of yours is behaving in any way suspiciously? Your move.
No, Mycroft, but you have to trust me.
I'll find the answer.
But it'll be in an odd phrase in an on-line blog, or an unexpected trip to the countryside, or a misplaced lonely hearts ad.
Your move! I've given the Prime Minister my personal assurance you're on the case.
I am on the case, we both are, look at us right now.
Oh, bugger! Whoopsy! Can't handle a broken heart.
How very telling.
Don't be smart.
That takes me back.
"Don't be smart, Sherlock, I'm the smart one.
" I am the smart one.
I used to think I was an idiot.
Both of us thought you were an idiot, Sherlock.
We had nothing else to go on, until we met other children.
Oh, yes, that was a mistake.
Ghastly.
What were they thinking of? Probably something about trying to make friends.
Oh, yes.
Friends.
Of course, you go in for that sort of thing now.
And you don't? Ever? If you seem slow to me, Sherlock, can you imagine what real people are like? I'm living in a world of goldfish.
Yes, but I've been away for two years.
So? Oh, I don't know, I thought perhaps you might have found yourself a goldfish.
Change the subject, now.
Rest assured, Mycroft, whatever this underground network of yours is up to, the secret will reside in something seemingly insignificant or bizarre.
Ooh-ooh.
Speaking of which I can't believe it.
I just can't believe it! Him sitting in his chair again.
Oh, isn't it wonderful, Mr Holmes? I can barely contain myself(!) Oh, he really can, you know.
He's secretly pleased to see you, underneath all that.
Sorry, which of us? Both of you.
Let's play something different.
Why are we playing games?! London's terror alert has been raised to critical, I'm just passing the time.
Let's do deductions.
Client left this while I was out, what do you reckon? I'm busy.
Oh, go on, it's been an age.
I always win.
Which is why you can't resist.
I find nothing irresistible in the hat of a well-travelled anxious, sentimental, unfit creature of habit with appalling halitosis.
Damn.
Isolated too, don't you think? Why would he be isolated? "He?" Obviously.
Why? Size of the hat? Don't be silly.
Some women have large heads too.
No, he's recently had his hair cut, you can see the little hairs adhering to the perspiration stains on the inside.
Some women have short hair too.
Balance of probability.
Not that you've ever spoken to a woman with short hair, or, you know, any woman.
Stains show he's out of condition.
He's sentimental because the hat has been repaired, three, four Five times.
Very neatly.
The cost of the repairs exceeds the cost of the hat, so he's mawkishly attached to it.
But it's more than that.
One patch or two patches would indicate sentimentality.
But five? Five's obsessive behaviour.
Obsessive compulsive.
Hardly.
Your client left it behind.
What sort of an obsessive compulsive would do that? The earlier patches are extensively sun bleached, so he's worn it abroad, in Peru.
Peru? This is a chullo.
The classic headgear of Andes, it's made of alpaca.
No.
No? Icelandic sheep wool.
Similar, but very distinctive, if you know what you're looking for.
I've written a blog on the varying tensile strengths of different natural fibres.
I'm sure there's a crying need for that(!) You said he was anxious? The bobble on the left side has been badly chewed, which shows he's a man of a nervous disposition, but But also a creature of habit, because he hasn't chewed the bobble on the right.
Precisely.
A quick sniff of the offending bobble tells us all we need to know about the state of his breath.
Brilliant! Elementary.
But you've missed his isolation.
I don't see it.
Plain as day.
Where? There for all to see.
Tell me.
Plain as the nose on your Tell me! Well, anybody who wears a hat as stupid as this isn't in the habit of hanging around other people, is he? Not at all.
Maybe he just doesn't mind being different.
He doesn't necessarily have to be isolated.
Exactly.
I'm sorry? He's different, so what? Why would he mind? You're quite right.
Why would anyone mind? I am not lonely, Sherlock.
How would you know? Yes.
Back to work, if you don't mind.
Good morning.
Right, back to work.
Mr Summerson.
Right.
Undescended testicle.
Right.
Sherlock? Hmm? Talk to John.
I've tried talking to him.
He made his position quite clear.
Just relax, Mr Summerson.
What did he say? F Cough.
Oh, dear.
Hi? 'Mrs Reeves.
Thrush.
' Right.
You wanted to see me? Yes.
Molly Yes? Would you? Would you like to Have dinner? .
.
Solve crimes? Um Absolutely nothing to be ashamed of, Mrs Reeves.
It's very common, but I'm recommending a course of Monkey glands, but enough about Professor Presbury.
Tell us more about your case, Mr Harcourt.
You sure about this? Absolutely.
Should I be making notes? If it makes you feel better.
That's what John says he does.
So if I'm being John You're not being John, you're being yourself.
Well, absolutely no one should have been able to empty that bank account other than myself and Helen.
Why didn't you assume it was your wife? Because I've always had total faith in her.
No, it's because YOU emptied it.
Weight-loss, hair dye, Botox, affair.
Lawyer.
Next! This is Mr Blake.
Piles.
Mr Blake, hi.
And your pen-pal's emails just stopped, did they? And you really thought he was the one, didn't you? The love of your life? Stepfather posing as on-line boyfriend.
What? Breaks it off, breaks her heart.
She swears off relationships, stays at home.
He still has her wage coming in.
Mr Windibank, you have been a complete and utter Piss pot.
It's nothing to worry about, just a small infection, by the sound of it.
Dr Verner is your usual GP, yes? Yeah, yeah, yeah.
He looked after me man and boy.
I run a little shop just on the corner of Church Street.
Oh.
Magazines and DVDs.
I've brought along a few little beauties that might interest you Tree Worshippers.
Oh, that's a corker.
It's very saucy.
And British Birds.
Same sort of thing.
I'm fine, thanks.
The Holy War.
Sounds a bit dry, I know, but there's a nun with all these holes in her habit Jesus! Sherlock.
What? What do you want? Uh? Have you come to torment me? What are you talking about? "What are you talking?" What, do you think I'm going to be fooled by this bloody beard?! You're crazy! No, no, no, no, no.
It's not as good as your French! Not as good as your French.
It's not even a good disguise, Sherlock! Where did you get it from, a bloody joke shop?! Oh, my God! I, I am so sorry.
Oh, my God! Please It's fine.
This one's got us all baffled.
Hmm, I don't doubt it.
What is it? You're onto something, aren't you? Maybe.
'Show off!' Shut up, John.
What? Hmm? Nothing.
Hello.
Hmm.
Are you sure? I'm sure.
OK.
I'm late for Cath.
I'll see you later.
Bye.
Bye.
This going to be your new arrangement, is it? Just giving it a go.
Right.
So, John? Not really in the picture any more.
Trains? Trains.
Male, 40 to 50.
Oh, sorry, did you want to be? Er, no, please, be my guest.
'You jealous?' Shut up! It doesn't make sense.
What doesn't? This skeleton, it can't be any more than Six months old.
Wow! "How I Did It, by Jack the Ripper.
" Uh-huh.
That's impossible.
Welcome to my world.
'Smart arse!' I won't insult your intelligence by explaining it to you.
No, please, insult away.
'You forgot to put your collar up.
' The corpse is, is six months old.
It's dressed in a shoddy Victorian outfit from a museum.
It's been displayed on a dummy for many years, in a case facing south-east, judging from the fading of the fabric.
It was sold off in a fire damage sale a week ago.
So the whole thing was a fake? Yes.
Looked so promising.
Facile.
Why would someone go to all that trouble? Why indeed, John? 'Mind the gap.
Mind the gap.
' Oh.
Thanks for hanging onto it.
No problem.
So, what's this all about, Mr Shilcott? My girlfriend's a big fan of yours.
Girlfriend?! Sorry.
Do go on.
I like trains.
Yes I work on the Tube, on the District Line, and part of my job is to wipe the security footage after it's been cleared.
I was just whizzing through and I found something a bit bizarre.
Now, this was a week ago.
The last train on the Friday night, Westminster Station.
Now, this man gets into the last car.
Car? They're cars, not carriages.
It's a legacy of the early American involvement in the Tube system.
He said he liked trains.
And the next stop, St James' Park Station.
And I thought you'd like it.
He gets into the last car at Westminster.
The only passenger.
And the car is empty at St James's Park Station.
Explain that, Mr Holmes.
Couldn't he have just jumped off? There's a safety mechanism that prevents the doors from opening in transit.
But there's something else, the driver of that train hasn't been to work since.
According to his flatmate, he's on holiday.
Came into some money.
Bought off? Hmm? So if the driver of the train was in on it, then the passenger did get off.
There's nowhere he could go.
It's a straight run on the District Line between the two stations.
There's no side tunnels, no maintenance tunnels.
Nothing on any map.
Nothing.
Train never stops and a man vanishes.
Good, innit? I know that face.
Excuse you(!) The journey between those stations usually takes five minutes and that one took ten.
Ten minutes to get from Westminster to St James's Park.
I'll need maps, lots of maps.
Older maps, all the maps.
Right.
Fancy some chips? What? I know a fantastic fish shop just off the Marylebone Road, the owner always gives me extra portions.
Did you get him off a murder charge? No, I helped him put up some shelves.
Sherlock? Hmm? What was today about? Saying thank you.
For what? For everything you did for me.
It's OK.
It's my pleasure.
No.
I mean it.
I don't mean pleasure, I mean I didn't mind.
I wanted to Moriarty slipped up, he made a mistake.
Because the one person he thought didn't matter at all to me was the one person that mattered the most.
You made it all possible.
But you can't do this again, can you? I've had a lovely day.
I'd love to, I just, um Hmm, congratulations, by the way.
He's not from work.
We met through friends, old-fashioned way.
He's nice, we've got a dog, we, we go to the pub on weekends and I've met his mum and dad and his friends and all his family.
I've no idea why I'm telling you any of this I hope you'll be very happy, Molly Hooper.
You deserve it.
After all, not all the men you fall for can turn out to be sociopaths.
No? No.
Maybe it's just my type.
Oh, Mrs Hudson, sorry, I think someone's got John.
John Watson? Hang on, who are you?! Oh, I'm his fiancee.
Oh.
Mary? What's wrong? Someone sent me this.
At first I thought it was just a Bible thing, you know, spam, but it's not.
It's a skip code.
First word, then every third.
"Save John Watson.
" Now! Where are we going? St James The Less, it's a church.
20 minutes by car.
Did you drive here? Er, yes.
It's too slow, it's too slow.
Watch out! What are we waiting for?! This.
What does it mean? What are they going to do to him? I don't know! Damn! Oi! Oi! You can't go down there! No, it's not going to work, with that.
I'll get something to help it along.
Yeah.
Help! Argh! He doesn't like it, Daddy.
Huh? Guy Fawkes, he doesn't like it.
Stay back, Zoe.
Back! Now.
What does it mean? Oh, my God! Help! Stand back! Move! Move! Move! Move! Move! John! John! John! John! Get up, John! John! John?! Help! John! John! John! Hey, John.
'Which wasn't the way I'd put it at all.
Silly woman.
' Anyway, it was then that I first noticed it was missing.
I said, "Have you checked down the back of the sofa?" He's always losing things down the back of the sofa, aren't you, dear? Afraid so.
Oh, keys, small change, sweeties.
Especially his glasses.
Glasses.
Blooming things.
I said, "Why don't you get a chain, "wear them round your neck?" And he says, "What, like Larry Grayson!" Larry Grayson.
So did you find it eventually, your lottery ticket? Well, yes, thank goodness.
We caught the coach on time after all.
We managed to see St Paul's, the Tower, but they weren't letting anyone into Parliament.
Some big debate going on.
John? Sorry, you're busy.
No, no, no, they were just leaving.
No, oh, were we? Yes.
No, no, if you've got a case No, not a case.
Yeah, go.
We're here till Saturday, remember.
Yes, wonderful.
Just get out! Yes, well, give us a ring.
Very nice, yes, good.
Get out! I can't tell you how glad we are, Sherlock.
All that time people thinking the worst.
We're just so pleased it's all over.
Ring up more often, won't you? Mm-hm.
She worries.
Promise? Promise.
Oh, for God Sorry about that.
No, it's fine.
Clients? Just my parents.
Your parents? In town for a few days.
Your parents? Mycroft promised to take them to a matinee of Les Mis.
Tried to talk me into doing it.
Those were your parents? Yes.
Well .
.
that is not what I What? I mean, they're just so .
.
ordinary.
It's a cross I have to bear.
Did they know too? Hmm? That you spent the last two years playing hide and seek? Maybe.
Ah, so that's why they weren't at the funeral! Sorry, sorry again.
Hmm.
Sorry.
So you've shaved it off then? Yeah.
Wasn't working for me.
Yeah, I'm glad.
You didn't like it? No, I prefer my doctors clean-shaven.
That's not a sentence you hear every day.
How are you feeling? Yeah, not bad.
Bit smoked.
Right.
Last night, who did that? And why did they target me? I don't know.
Is it someone trying to get to you through me? Is it something to do with this terrorist thing you talked about? I don't know, I can't see the pattern.
It's too nebulous.
Why would an agent give his life to tell us something incredibly insignificant? That's what's strange.
Give his life? According to Mycroft.
There's an underground network planning an attack on London, that's all we know.
These are my rats, John.
Rats? My markers, agents, lowlifes.
People who might find themselves arrested or their diplomatic immunity suddenly rescinded.
If one of them starts acting suspiciously, we know something's up.
Five of them are behaving perfectly normally, but the sixth I know him, don't I? Lord Moran, Peer of the Realm.
Minister for Overseas Development.
Pillar of the Establishment.
Yes.
He's been working for North Korea since 1996.
What? He's the big rat, rat number one.
He's just done something very suspicious indeed.
Yeah, that's odd.
There's nowhere he could have got off? Not according to the maps.
There's something, something, something I'm missing.
Something staring me in the face.
Any idea who they are, this underground network? Intelligence must have a list of the most obvious ones.
Our rat's just come out of his den.
Al-Qaeda? The IRA have been getting restless again, maybe they're going to make an appearance Yes, yes, yes, yes! I've been an idiot, a blind idiot! What? Oh, that's good.
That could be brilliant! What are you on about? Mycroft's intelligence is not nebulous at all, it's specific, incredibly specific.
What do you mean? It's not an underground network, John, it's an Underground network! Right.
What? Sometimes a deception is so audacious, so outrageous that you can't see it even when it's staring you in the face.
Look, seven carriages leave Westminster.
Mm.
And only six carriages arrive at St James's Park.
Ah, but that's, I mean, it's impossible.
Moran didn't disappear.
The entire tube compartment did.
The driver must have diverted the train and then detached the last carriage.
Detached it where? You said there was nothing between those stations.
Not on the maps, but once you eliminate the other factors, the remaining thing must be the truth.
That carriage vanished, so it must be somewhere.
But why, though? Why detach it in the first place? It vanishes between St James's Park and Westminster.
Lord Moran vanishes.
You're kidnapped and nearly burnt to death at a fireworks party.
What's the date, John, today's date? Hmm? November the Oh, God! Lord Moran, he's a Peer of the Realm.
Normally he'd sit in the House.
Tonight, there's an all-night sitting to vote on the new anti-terrorism bill.
But he won't be there, not tonight.
Not the 5th November.
"Remember, remember" "Gunpowder, treason and plot!" 'There's nothing down there, Mr Holmes, I told you.
'No sidings, no ghost stations.
' There has to be, check again.
This whole area is a big mess of old and new stuff.
Charing Cross is made up of bits of older stations, like Trafalgar Square, Strand.
No, it's none of those, we've accounted for those.
St Margaret Street, Bridge Street, Sumatra Road, Parliament Street 'Hang on, hang on, Sumatra Road? 'You mentioned Sumatra Road, Mr Holmes? There is something, 'I knew it rang a bell! Yes.
'There was a station down there.
' Well, why isn't it on the maps? 'Because it was closed before it ever opened.
' What? 'They built the platforms, even the staircases, but it all got tied up 'in legal disputes and so they never built the station on the surface.
' It's right underneath the Palace of Westminster.
So what's down there, a bomb? Oh.
'With many commentators saying 'the vote on the Terrorism Bill will be too close to call, 'MPs are now making their way into the Chamber for what 'the Government is calling "the most important vote of this Parliament.
" 'Over now to our' 'What freedoms exactly are we protecting 'if we start spying on our own people? 'This is a Orwellian measure on a scale unprecedented' There's a bomb, then? The tube carriage is carrying a bomb.
Must be.
Right.
What are you doing? I'm calling the police.
What? No! Sherlock, this isn't a game, they need to evacuate Parliament.
They'll get in the way, they always do.
This is cleaner, more efficient.
And illegal? A bit.
What are you doing? Coming.
I don't understand.
Well, that's a first.
There's nowhere else it could be.
Oh! What?! Hang on, Sherlock? What? That's, isn't it live? Perfectly safe as long as we avoid touching the rails.
Of course, yeah, avoid the rails.
Great! This way.
Are you sure? Sure.
Ha! Look at that.
John Hmm? Demolition charges.
It's empty.
There's nothing.
Isn't there? This is the bomb.
What? It's not carrying explosives, the whole compartment is the bomb.
We need bomb disposal.
There may not be time for that now.
So what do we do? I have no idea.
Well, think of something.
Why do you think I know what to do? Cos you're Sherlock Holmes, you're as clever as it gets.
It doesn't mean I know how to defuse a giant bomb! What about you?! I wasn't in bomb disposal, I'm a bloody doctor! And a soldier, as you keep reminding us all! Can't Can't we rip the timer off, or something? That would set it off.
You see, you know things! Oh! Er My God! Er Why didn't you call the police?! Can you just? Why do you never call the police?! Well, it's no use now.
So you can't switch the bomb off?! You can't switch the bomb off and you didn't call the police! Go, John.
Go now! There's no point now, is there, because there's not enough time to get away and if we don't do this, other people will die! Mind palace! Hmm? Use your mind palace! How will that help? You've salted away every fact under the sun! And you think I've just got "how to defuse a bomb" tucked away in there somewhere?! Yes! Maybe.
Think! Think, please think.
Think! I can't! Oh, my God! This is it.
Um, er Oh, my God! Turn that off.
Oh, God! Er, um, er I'm sorry.
What? I can't, I can't do it, John.
I don't know how.
Forgive me.
What?! Please, John, forgive me, for all the hurt that I caused you.
No, no, no, no, no, no, this is a trick.
No.
Another one of your bloody tricks.
No.
You're just trying to make me say something nice.
Not this time.
It's just to make you look good even though you've behaved like I wanted you not to be dead.
Yeah, well, be careful what you wish for.
If I hadn't come back, you wouldn't be standing there and .
.
you'd still have a future, with Mary.
Yeah, I know.
Look, I find it difficult.
I find it difficult, this sort of stuff.
I know.
You were the best and the wisest man that I have ever known.
Yes, of course I forgive you.
The criminal network Moriarty headed was vast.
Its roots were everywhere, like a cancer, so we came up with a plan.
Mycroft fed Moriarty information about me.
Moriarty, in turn, gave us hints, just hints as to the extent of his web.
We let him go, because it was important to let him believe he had the upper hand.
And then, I sat back and watched Moriarty destroy my reputation, bit by bit.
I had to make him believe he'd beaten me, utterly defeated me, and then he'd show his hand.
There were 13 likely scenarios once we were up on that roof.
Each of them were rigorously worked out and given a code name.
It wasn't just my reputation that Moriarty needed to bury.
I had to die.
Sherlock! You can have me arrested, you can torture me, you can do anything you like with me, but nothing's going to prevent them from pulling the trigger.
Your only three friends in the world will die, unless Unless I kill myself and complete your story.
You've got to admit that's sexier.
'But the one thing I didn't anticipate was just how far 'Moriarty was prepared to go.
I suppose that was obvious, 'given our first meeting at the swimming pool.
'His death wish.
' Argh! 'I knew I didn't have long.
'I contacted my brother, set the wheels in motion.
'And then everyone got to work.
' 'It's a trick.
' 'It's just a magic trick.
' 'All right, stop it now.
' 'Now, stay exactly where you are.
' 'Don't move!' All right.
Keep your eyes fixed on me.
Please, will you do this for me? 'It was vital that John stayed just where I'd put him 'and that way his view was blocked by the ambulance station.
' Sherlock! 'I needed to hit the air-bag, 'which I did.
'Speed was paramount.
'The air-bag needed to be got out of the way 'just as John cleared the station.
'But we needed him to see a body.
'That's where Molly came in.
'Like figures on a weather clock, we went one way, John went the other.
'Then, our well-timed cyclist' '.
.
put John briefly out of action, 'giving me time to switch places with the corpse on the pavement.
'The rest was just window dressing.
' 'And one final touch, a squash ball under the armpit.
'Apply enough pressure and it momentarily cuts off the pulse.
' Let me come through, please! It's all right No, he's my friend.
It's all right.
No, he's my friend.
It's all right, it's all right He's my friend, please.
Everything was anticipated, every eventuality allowed for.
It worked perfectly.
Molly.
Molly Hooper? She was in on it? Yes.
You remember the little girl who was abducted by Moriarty? Get out! 'You assumed she reacted like that because I was her kidnapper.
' But I deduced Moriarty must have found someone who looked very like me to plant suspicion, and that that man, whoever he was, had to be got out of the way as soon as his usefulness ended.
That meant there was a corpse in the morgue somewhere that looked just like me.
Clever.
Molly found the body, faked the records and I provided the other coat.
I've got lots of coats.
What about the sniper aiming at John? Mycroft's men intervened before he could take the shot.
He was invited to reconsider.
Is it done? Good.
And your homeless network? As I explained, the whole street was closed off.
Like a scene from a play.
Neat, don't you think? Hmm What? Not the way I'd have done it.
Oh, really? No, I'm not saying it's not clever, but What? Bitdisappointed.
Oh.
Everyone's a critic.
Anyway, that's not why I came.
No? No, I think you know why I'm here, Phillip.
"How I Did It, by Jack the Ripper?" Didn't you think it was intriguing? Lurid.
A case so sensational you hoped I'd be interested.
But you overdid it, Phillip.
You and your little fan-club.
I just couldn't live with myself, knowing that I'd driven you to But you didn't.
You were always right, I wasn't dead.
No.
No, and everything's OK now, isn't it? Yeah.
Yeah.
Though of course you've wasted police time.
Perverted the course of justice.
Risked distracting me from a massive terrorist assault that could have both destroyed Parliament and caused the death of hundreds of people.
Oh, God! Oh, God, I'm sorry, Sherlock! I'm so sorry.
Hang on.
That doesn't make sense.
How could you be sure John would stand on that exact spot? I mean, what if he'd moved? Andhow did you do it all so quickly? What if the bike hadn't hit him? And anyway, why are you telling me all this? If you'd pulled that off, I'm the last person you'd tell the truth to! Sherlock Holmes! You Oh, your face! .
.
utter Your face! You! Totally had you! You cock! I knew it! I knew it! You Oh, those things you said, such sweet things.
I never knew you cared.
I will, I'll kill you if you ever breathe a word of this Scout's honour.
.
.
to anyone! You knew! You knew how to turn it off! There's an off switch.
There's always an off switch.
Terrorists can get into all sorts of problems unless there's an off switch.
So why did you let me go through all that?! I didn't lie altogether.
I've absolutely no idea how to turn any of these silly little lights off.
And you did call the police? Of course I called the police.
I'm definitely going to kill you! Oh, please.
Killing me, that's so two years ago.
'Sherlock, please, I beg of you.
'You can take over at the interval.
' Oh, I'm sorry, brother dear, but you made a promise.
Nothing I can do to help.
'But you don't understand the pain of it, the horror.
' Come on, you'll have to go down, they want the story.
In a minute.
I'm really pleased, Mary.
Have you set a date? Well, we thought May.
Ah, a spring wedding.
Yeah.
Well, once we've actually got engaged.
Yeah.
We were interrupted last time.
Yeah.
Well, I can't wait.
You will be there, Sherlock? Weddings, not really my thing.
Hello, everyone.
Hello, Molly.
This is Tom.
Tom, this is everyone.
Hi.
Hi.
It's really nice to meet you all.
Hi.
Wow! Yeah, hi, I'm John, good to meet you.
Ready? Ready.
Champagne? Yes.
Thanks.
Thank you.
Sit down, love.
Oh, thanks.
So um Is it serious, you two? Yeah.
I've moved on.
Did you? I'm not saying a word.
No, best not.
But I'm still waiting.
Hmm? Why did they try and kill me? If they knew you were onto them, why come after me? Put me in a bonfire? I don't know.
I don't like not knowing.
Unlike the nicely embellished fictions on your blog, John, real life is rarely so neat.
I don't know who was behind all this, but I will find out, I promise you.
Don't pretend you're not enjoying this.
Hmm? Being back.
Being a hero again.
Don't be stupid.
You'd have to be an idiot not to see it.
You love it.
Love what? Being Sherlock Holmes.
I don't even know what that's supposed to mean.
Sherlock, you are going to tell me how you did it? How you jumped off that building and survived? You know my methods, John, I am known to be indestructible.
No, but seriously.
When you were dead, I went to your grave.
I should hope so.
I made a little speech.
I actually spoke to you.
I know.
I was there.
I asked you for one more miracle.
I asked you to stop being dead.
I heard you.
Anyway, time to go and be Sherlock Holmes.
'John!' 'John!' 'John! 'John! 'John!'
They just walked out of there.
Yeah, I know, I was sort of sitting next to you.
The whole Waters family, they just walked right out of there.
- Again, I was in the room.
- How do they always manage that? They're good.
They're greedy and they'll do it again.
And next time, we're going to catch them in the act.
How? - No good? -They always know we're coming.
-(SIREN WAILING) -How do they always know? They're good, they work at it.
- They're never going to stop.
-Well, neither are we.
(GRUNTS) (LESTRADE GRUNTING) - Greg.
-In the act! The only way we're going to do this, in the act! (BEEPING) You still blocking it? Yeah, very efficiently hacked.
They must be bloody pleased with themselves.
They must be.
Right, then.
Ah, no.
You go make the arrest.
This one's yours, boss.
You've never called me boss before.
No? Well, look what happens when you're good.
You know how most days aren't good days? - This is a good day.
-Not for the Waters family.
(MOBILE CHIMING) Okay, 10 men on the roof.
All exits covered.
The bank's closed so we've no hostages to worry about.
(CHIMING CONTINUES) Sorry, no, go on, go on.
Um, we've got the tunnel entrance covered and Davis, Welland Christie are heading up.
- Armed Response aren't mucking around.
-(CHIMING CONTINUES) Sorry, I'd better get this.
It's him, isn't it? - I I have to go.
-What? - You make the arrest.
-No way.
Sorry, you'll be fine.
I'm cool with this.
Jones will get all the credit if you leave now and you know he will.
Yeah, well Yeah, it doesn't matter, I'll have to go.
Backup, I need maximum backup.
Baker Street, now.
What's going on? - This is hard.
-What? Really hard.
Hardest thing I've ever had to do.
Do you know any funny stories about John? (SIREN WAILING, TYRES SCREECHING) What? I need anecdotes.
Didn't go to any trouble, did you? (HELICOPTER HOVERING) (VIOLIN PLAYING) - Shut up, Mrs Hudson.
-I haven't said a word.
(SIGHING) You're formulating a question and it's physically painful watching you think.
I thought it was you playing.
It was me playing.
l am composing.
You were dancing.
- I was road-testing.
-You what? Why are you here? I'm bringing you your morning tea.
You're not usually awake.
You bring me tea in the morning? (CHUCKLING) Where do you think it came from? I don't know, I just thought it sort of happened.
Your mother has a lot to answer for.
Mmm, I know.
I have a list.
Mycroft has a file.
So, it's the big day, then.
What big day? The wedding.
John and Mary are getting married.
Two people who currently who live together are about to attend church, have a party, go on a short holiday, then carry on living together.
What's big about that? It changes people, marriage.
Mmm, no, it doesn't.
Well, you wouldn't understand 'cause you always live alone.
Your husband was executed for double murder, you're hardly an advert for companionship.
Marriage changes you as a person in ways that you can't imagine.
As does lethal injection.
My best friend, Margaret, she was my chief bridesmaid, we were going to be best friends forever, we always said that.
But I hardly saw her after that.
Aren't there usually biscuits? - I've run out.
-Have the shops? She cried the whole day, saying, "Ooh, it's the end of an era.
" I'm sure the shop on the corner is open.
She was probably right, really.
I remember she left early.
I mean, who leaves a wedding early? So sad.
Mmm.
Anyway, you've got things to do.
No, not really.
I've got plenty of time - Biscuits! -(GASPS) I really am going to have a word with your mother.
You can if you like, she understands very little.
(SIGHING) Right, then.
(INHALING) Into battle.
(CHURCH BELLS RINGING) PHOTOGRAPHER: Congratulations! Okay, hold it there, I want to get this shot of the newlyweds.
Ah,just the bride and groom, please.
- Sherlock.
-Oh, sorry.
(CLEARING THROAT) PHOTOGRAPHER: Okay.
Three, two, one.
- Cheese.
-(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING) The famous Mr Holmes.
I'm very pleased to meet you.
- But no sex, okay? -Sorry? You don't have to look so scared.
I'm only messing.
Bridesmaid, best man, it's a bit traditional.
Is it? But not obligatory.
If that's the sort of thing you're looking for, the man over there in blue is your best bet.
Recently divorced doctor with a ginger cat, a barn conversion and a history of erectile dysfunction.
Reviewing that information, possibly not your best bet.
Yeah, maybe not.
Sorry, there was one more deduction there than I was expecting.
Mr Holmes, you're going to be incredibly useful.
(CAMERA CLICKING) Hello, lovely to meet you.
- How are you? -Beautiful, Mary.
Thank you.
David.
(LAUGHING) Mary.
Congratulations.
- You look, um, very nice.
-Thanks.
John, congratulations.
You're a lucky man.
Thank you.
Urn, David, this is Sherlock.
- Mmm.
-Um, yeah, we've, um We've met.
So what exactly are my duties as an usher? Let's talk about Mary first.
- Sorry, what? -Oh, I think you know what.
You went out with her for two years.
(NERVOUSLY) Ages ago.
We're just good friends now.
Is that a fact? Whenever she tweets, you respond within five minutes, regardless of time or current location, suggesting you have her on text alert.
In all your Facebook photographs of the happy couple, Mary takes centre frame, whereas John is always partly or entirely excluded.
Wait, you can't assume from that that I've still got some kind of interest in Mary? You've volunteered to be a shoulder to cry on on no less than three separate occasions.
Do you have anything to say in your defence? I think from now on we'll downgrade you to casual acquaintance, no more than three planned social encounters a year and always in John's presence.
I have your contact details.
I will be monitoring.
They're right about you.
You're a bloody psychopath.
High-functioning sociopath.
With your number.
(STAMMERING) Hello.
Thanks for coming, thank you.
Oh.
Yes, um, well done in the service, Archie.
He's really come out of his shell.
I don't know how you did it.
(CHUCKLING) Um Basically, it's a cute smile to the bride's side, cute smile to the groom's side and then the rings.
- No.
-And you have to wear the outfit.
- No.
-You really do have to wear the outfit.
- What for? -Grownups like that sort of thing.
Why? I don't know.
I'll ask one.
You're a detective? Yep.
- Have you solved any murders? -Sure, loads.
Can I see? Yeah, all right.
(BEEPING) What's all that stuff in his eye? Maggots.
- Cool.
-Hmm.
He said you had some pictures for him as a treat.
Er, yes, if he's good.
Beheadings.
Lovely little village.
Hmm? What did you say? Hold it.
Nice.
- Vol-au-vent? - I'm starving.
- Thanks.
-I had to lose so much weight -to get into this dress.
-(LAUGHING) Mmm.
He's nice.
Traces of two leading brands of deodorant, both advertised for their strength.
Suggestive of a chronic body odour problem manifesting under stress.
Okay, done there.
What about his friend? Long-term relationship.
Compulsive cheat.
- Seriously? Waterproof cover on the smartphone.
Yet his complexion doesn't indicate outdoor work.
Suggests he's in the habit of taking his phone into the shower with him, which means he often receives texts and emails he'd rather went unseen.
- Can I keep you? -Do you like solving crimes? Do you have a vacancy? - So, Harry? -Uh, no, no show.
Darling, I'm so sorry.
Yeah, it was a bit of a punt asking, I suppose.
Still, free bar, wouldn't have been a good mix.
Oh.
God, wow.
- Is that -He came.
So that's him.
- Major Sholto.
-Uh-huh.
If they're such good friends, why does he barely even mention him? He mentions him all the time to me.
Never shuts up about him.
- About him? -Mmm-hmm.
Ugh, I chose this wine.
It's bloody awful.
Yes, but it's definitely him that he talks about? Mmm-hmm.
I'm very, very glad to see you, sir.
I know you don't really do this sort of thing.
Well, I do for old friends, Watson.
John - It's good to see you.
-You, too.
Civilian life suiting you, then? Er, yes, well, I think so, sir.
No more need for the trick cyclist? No, I go now and then.
Sort of a top-up.
Therapy can be very helpful.
Where are you living these days? Oh, way out in the middle of nowhere.
You wouldn't know it.
- JOHN: You look well.
-I've never even heard him say his name.
Well, he's almost a recluse.
- You know, since -Yes.
I didn't think he'd show up at all.
John says he's the most unsociable man he's ever met.
- He is? He's the most unsociable? -Mmm.
Ah, that's why he's bouncing around him like a puppy.
Oh, Sherlock.
Neither of us were the first, you know.
- Stop smiling.
-It's my wedding day.
(GASPS) (POUNDING FOOTSTEPS) (EXHALES) (MOBILE RINGING) Yes.
What? - Sherlock.
-Why are you out of breath? Filing.
Either I've caught you in a compromising position or you've been working out again.
Favour the latter.
- What do you want? -I need your answer, Mycroft, as a matter of urgency.
- Answer? - Even at the eleventh hour it's not too late to know.
Oh, Lord.
Cars can be ordered, private jets commandeered.
Today.
It's today, isn't it? No, Sherlock, I will not be coming to the "night do", as you so poetically put it.
What a shame.
Mary and John will be extremely Delighted not to have me hanging around.
Oh, I don't know.
There should always be a spectre at the feast.
So, this is it, then? The big day.
I suppose I'll be seeing a lot more of you from now on.
- What do you mean? -It'll be just like old times.
No, I don't understand.
Well, it's the end of an era, isn't it? John and Maw.
Domestic bliss.
Ne, no, no.
I prefer to think of it as the beginning of a new chapter.
- What? -Nothing.
I know that silence.
What? Well, I'd better let you get back to it.
You have a big speech or something, don't you? - What? - Cakes.
Karaoke.
Mingling, Mycroft! This is what people do, Sherlock.
They get married.
I warned you.
Don't get involved.
Involved? I'm not involved.
- No.
-John asked me to be his best man.
- How could I say no? - Absolutely.
- I'm not involved.
-I believe you.
Really, I do.
Have a lovely day and do give the happy couple my best.
I will.
Oh, by the way, Sherlock.
Do you remember Redhead? I'm not a child any more, Mycroft.
No, of course you're not.
Enjoy not getting involved, Sherlock.
Pray silence for the best man.
(ALL CHEERING) Ladies and gentlemen, family and friends.
And, urn others.
- Uh -(CLEARING THROAT) (STAMMERING) Also - Greg.
-Molly.
I just had a thought.
Is that a brain? What if John asks Sherlock to be his best man? - Well, he will.
He's bound to.
-Exactly.
- So? -So, he'll have to make a speech in front of people.
There will be actual people there actually listening.
Well, what's the worst that could happen? Helen Louise probably wondered the same.
Helen Louise? (PHONE RINGING) Oh, hello, dear.
I was just thinking, if John does ask Sherlock What, the speech, dear? I know.
It'll be fine.
It's not just the speech, though, is it? (MRS HUDSON LAUGHING) Mrs Hudson? - Oh, no, darling.
-You all right? I was going to see Sherlock and I thought you were - No.
-possibly dying.
I'm sorry.
What's wrong? The telegrams.
- Sorry, what? -Oh, sorry.
(CONTINUES LAUGHING) The telegrams.
Right, urn -(CLEARING THROAT) -Mmm.
First things first.
Telegrams.
Well, they' re not actually telegrams.
We just call them telegrams, I don't know why.
Wedding tradition.
Because we don't have enough of that already, apparently.
"To Mr and Mrs Watson.
"So sorry I'm unable to be with you on your special day.
"Good luck and best wishes, Mike Stanford.
" - Ah, Mike.
-Aw.
"To John and Mary.
"All good wishes for your special day.
With love and many big "big squishy cuddles from Stella and Ted.
" -(CHUCKLES) -"Mary, lots of love" Oh! - Yeah? -"poppet.
" "Oodles of love and heaps of good wishes from Cam.
"Wish your family could have seen this.
" - Hey, hmm? -Yep.
Urn "Special day.
" "Very special day.
" "Love.
" "Love.
" "Love.
" "Love.
" "Love.
" Bit of a theme, you get the general gist.
People are basically fond.
(GUESTS LAUGHING) John Watson.
My friend,John Watson.
John When John first broached the subject of being best man, I was confused.
Sherlock? -What was that noise downstairs? Ah, it was Mrs Hudson laughing.
It sounds like she was torturing an owl.
Yeah, well it was laughter.
Could have been both.
- Busy? - (SIGHING) Just occupying myself.
Sometimes it's so hard not smoking.
Mind if I interrupt? Oh, be my guest.
- Tea? -Ah So.
(CLEARING THROAT) - The big question.
-Mmm-hmm? The best man.
- The best man? -What do you think? Billy Kincaid.
- Sorry, what? -Billy Kincaid, the Camden Garrotter.
Best man I ever knew.
Vast contributions to charity never disclosed.
Personally managed to save three hospitals from closure, and ran the best and safest children's homes in North England.
Yes, every now and again there would be some garrottings, but stacking up the lives saved against the garrottings, -on balance I'd say -For my wedding.
For me.
I need a best man.
Oh, right.
- Maybe not a garrotter.
-Gavin? - Who? - Gavin Lestrade.
He's a man and good at it.
It's Greg.
And he's not my best friend.
Oh, Mike Stanford, I see.
Well, he's nice, urn Though I'm not sure how well he'd cope with No, Mike's great, but he's not my best friend.
Look, Sherlock, this is the biggest and most important day of my life.
- Well -No, it is.
It is.
And I want to be up there with the two people that I love and care about -most in the world.
-Yes.
- Mary Morstan -Yes.
and Wu, I confess at first I didn't realise he was asking me.
When finally I understood, I expressed to him that I was both flattered and surprised.
I explained to him that I had never expected this request and I was a little daunted in the face of it.
Sherlock? I nonetheless promised that I would do my very best to accomplish a task which was, for me, as demanding and difficult as any I had ever contemplated.
Additionally, I thanked him for the trust he placed in me and indicated that I was, in some ways, very close to being moved by it.
No, it's getting a bit scary now.
It Later transpired that I'd said none of this out aloud.
(ALL LAUGHING) So, in fact - You-you mean -Yes.
I'm yourbest - Man.
-friend? Yeah, of course you are.
Course you're my best friend.
Well, how was that? Surprisingly okay.
So you'll have to make a speech, of course.
SHERLOCK: (CLEARING THROAT) So Done that.
Done that.
Done that bit.
Done that bit.
Done that bit.
I'm afraid, John, I can't congratulate you.
All emotions, and in particular love, stand opposed to the pure cold reason I hold above all things.
A wedding is, in my considered opinion, nothing short of a celebration of all that is false and specious and irrational and sentimental in this ailing and morally compromised world.
Today we honour the deathwatch beetle that is the doom of our society and in time, one feels certain, our entire species.
But anyway, let's talk about John.
Please.
(CLEARING THROAT) If I burden myself with a little helpmate during my adventures, it is not out of sentiment or caprice, it is that he has many fine qualities of his own that he has overlooked in his obsession with me.
Indeed, any reputation I have for mental acuity and sharpness comes in truth from the extraordinary contrast John so selflessly provides.
It is a fact, I believe, that brides tend to favour exceptionally plain bridesmaids for their big day.
There is a certain analogy there, I feel.
And contrast is, after all, God's own plan to enhance the beauty of his creation.
Or it would be if God were not a ludicrous fantasy designed to provide a career opportunity for the family idiot.
(GUESTS MURMURING) The point I'm trying to make is that I am the most unpleasant, rude, ignorant and all-round obnoxious arsehole that anyone could possibly have the misfortune to meet.
l am dismissive of the virtuous, unaware of the beautiful, and uncomprehending in the face of the happy.
So if I didn't understand I was being asked to be best man, it is because I never expected to be anybody's best friend.
And certainly not the best friend of the bravest and kindest and wisest human being I have ever had the good fortune of knowing.
WOMAN: Aw.
John, I am a ridiculous man.
Redeemed only by the warmth and constancy of your friendship.
But as I am, apparently, your best friend, I cannot congratulate you on your choice of companion.
Actually, now I can.
Mary, when I say you deserve this man, it is the highest compliment of which I am capable.
John, you have endured war and injury and tragic loss.
So sorry again about that last one.
So know this.
Today you sit between the woman you have made your wife and the man you have saved.
In short, the two people who love you most in all this world.
And I know I speak for Mary as well when I say we will never let you down and we have a lifetime ahead to prove that.
(SOBBING) - If I try and hug him, stop me.
- Certainly not.
Ah, yes.
Now onto some funny stories about John.
(JOHN CLEARING THROAT) What's wrong? What happened? Why are you all doing that? John? Oh, Sherlock.
Did I do it wrong? No, you didn't.
Come here.
(ALL APPLAUDING) - I haven't finished yet.
-Yeah, I know.
I know.
- So onto some funny stories {an you wait till I sit down? (CLEARING THROAT) So onto some funny stories about John.
If you could all just cheer up a bit, that would -(ALL LAUGHING) -be better.
On we go.
So for funny stories, one has to look no further than John's blog.
The record of our time together.
Of course, he does tend to romanticise things a bit but then, you know, he's a romantic.
We've tackled some strange cases.
The Hollow Client.
The Poisoned Giant.
Get down,John! We've had some frustrating cases.
(SIGHING) What is that? A French decathlete found completely out of his mind surrounded by 1,812 matchboxes, all empty, except this one.
And what's in that one? The inexplicable.
Touching cases.
She's going to ring the doorbell.
Oh, no, she's changed her mind.
No, she's going to do it.
No, she's leaving.
She's leaving.
(CLEARING THROAT) Oh, she's coming back.
She's a client, she's boring.
I've seen those symptoms before.
Hmm? Oscillation on the pavement always means there's a love affair.
And of course, I have to mention The Elephant in the Room.
(ELEPHANT TRUMPETING) But we want something very particular for this special day, don't we? The Bloody Guardsman.
Need to work on your half of the church, Mary.
- Looking a bit thin.
-Oh.
Orphan's lot.
Friends, that's all I have.
Lots of friends.
Schedule the organ music to begin at precisely 11:118 But the rehearsal's not for another two weeks.
just calm down.
Calm? I am calm, I'm extremely calm.
Let's get back to the reception.
Come on.
John's cousin, top table? Hmm, hates you.
Can't even bear to think about you.
Seriously? Second-class post.
Cheap card.
Bought at a petrol station.
Look at the stamp.
Three attempts at licking.
She's obviously unconsciously retaining saliva.
Aw, let's stick her by the bogs.
- Oh, yes.
-(MARY CLEARING THROAT) Who else hates me? Oh, great.
Thanks.
"Priceless painting nicked.
" Looks interesting.
- Table four? -Done.
(CHUCKLING) "My husband is three people.
" - Table five? - Major James Sholto.
Who he? Oh, John's old commanding officer.
I don't think he's coming.
- JOHN: He'll be there.
-Well, he needs to RSVP, then.
He'll be there.
"My husband is three people.
" It's interesting.
Says he has three distinct patterns of moles on his skin.
Identical triplets.
One in half a million births.
Solved it without leaving the flat.
Now, serviettes.
Swan or Sydney Opera House? Where did you learn to do that? Many unexpected skills required in the field of criminal investigation.
- Fibbing, Sherlock.
-I once broke an alibi by demonstrating the exact severity of I'm not John.
I can tell when you're fibbing.
Okay.
I learnt it on YouTube.
Opera House, please.
Oh, hang on.
I'm buzzing.
Hello? Oh, hi, Beth.
Yeah, yeah, I don't see why not.
Actually, if that's Beth, it's probably for me, too.
Hang on.
He knows we don't have a friend called Beth.
He's going to figure out that it's code.
- He's YouTubing serviettes.
- He's thorough.
- He's terrified.
-Of course he's not.
Right, you know when you're scared of something, you start wishing it sooner just to get it all going? That's what he's doing.
Why would he be scared that we're getting married? It's not going to change anything.
We'll still do stuff.
We need to prove it to him.
I told you to 'Find him a new case.
- I'm trying.
-You need to run him, okay? Show him it's still the good old days.
That just sort of happened.
Sherlock, urn mate.
I've (SIGHING) I've smelled 18 different perfumes.
I've sampled nine different slices of cake, which all tasted identical.
I like the bridesmaids in purple.
- Lilac.
-Lilac.
Urn, there are no more decisions left to make.
I don't even understand the decisions that we have made.
I'm faking opinions and it's exhausting.
So please, before she comes back (CLEARING THROAT) pick something.
Anything, pick one.
-Pick what? (LAUGHING) A case.
Your inbox is bursting.
just get me out of here.
You want to go out on a case? Now? Please.
Sherlock, for me.
Don't you worry about anything.
I'll get you out of this.
(MOBILE BEEPING) Oh.
Dear, Mr Holmes, my name is Bainbridge.
I'm a private in Her Majesty's Household Guard.
I'm writing to you about a personal matter, one I don't care to bring before my superiors, it would sound so trivial.
But I think someone's stalking me.
I'm used to tourists, it's part of the job.
But this is different.
Someone's watching me.
He's taking pictures of me every day.
don't want to mention it to the manager but it's really preying on my mind.
Uniform fetishist.
All the nice girls like a soldier.
It's sailor.
And Bainbridge thinks his stalker is a bloke.
Let's go and investigate.
- Please? -Elite guard.
Forty enlisted men and officers.
Why this particular grenadier? Curious.
- Now you're talking.
-Okay.
-(CLEARING THROAT) -Bye.
Uh, we??re just going to I need, urn, Sherlock to help me choose some - Tie.
-socks.
- Why don't we go with socks? -Yeah.
I mean, you've got to get the right ones.
Exactly.
To go with my - Tie.
-outfit.
(SIGHING) Well, it'll take a while, right? - My coat in there? -Yes.
Just going to take him out for a bit.
- Run him.
-I know.
You said you'd find him a case.
- Coming, Sherlock? -Coming.
Taxi! GUARD: Company, halt! Right turn! We're here to see Private Steven Bainbridge.
He's on duty right now, sir.
I'll certainly let him know when he's free.
And when will that be? Another hour.
SHERLOCK: You think they give them classes? Classes? How to resist the temptation to scratch their behinds.
Afferent neurons in the peripheral nervous system.
- Bum itch.
-Oh.
So why don't you see him any more? - Who? -Your previous commander, Sholto.
- Previous commander? -I meant ex.
"Previous" suggests that I currently have a commander.
- Which you don't.
-Which I don't.
Of course you don't.
He was decorated, wasn't he? - A war hero.
-Not to everyone.
(CLEARING THROAT) He led a team of crows into battle.
- Crows? -New recruits.
It's standard procedure, break the new boys in, but it went wrong.
They all died.
He was the only survivor.
The press and the families gave him hell.
He gets more death threats than you.
Oh, I wouldn't count on that.
Why have you suddenly taken an interest in another human being? I'm chatting.
Won't be trying that again.
Changing the subject completely You know it won't alter anything, right? Me and Mary getting married.
We'll still be doing all this.
Oh, good.
If you were worried.
I wasn't worried.
(CHUCKLING) The thing about Mary, she has completely turned my life around.
Changed everything.
But for the record, over the last few years, there are two people who have done that and the other one is a complete dickhead.
(GUARDS MARCHING OUTSIDE) (INDISTINCT CHATTER AND LAUGHTER) Can I ask what this is in connection with? Private Bainbridge contacted us about a personal matter, sir.
Nothing's personal when it concerns my troops.
- What do you really want? -I'm here on a legitimate enquiry.
You press? Digging for some bloody royal story or something? No, sir, I'm Captain John Watson, Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers Retired.
You could be a used car salesman now, for all I know.
-(SHOWER RUNNING) -Bainbridge? Gentleman hereto see you.
Bainbridge! I know you, don't I? Hmm? I've seen you in the papers.
Hanging around with that detective, the one with the silly hat.
What the hell does Bainbridge want with a detective? I'm afraid I'm not at liberty to say.
You're not at liberty to say? He's a soldier in my regiment.
I'll be damned if he's going to get up to cloak-and-dagger nonsense like this.
-(DOOR OPENING) -Sir.
- Sir.
-What's going on? It's Bainbridge, sir.
He's dead.
My god! (SIGHING) Let me take a look, sir, I'm a doctor.
What? Sergeant, arrest this man.
What? No, no, I'm a doctor.
Oh, you're a doctor now, too? - Sergeant.
-Let me examine him, please.
Sir, caught this one snooping around.
Is that what this is all about? Distracting me so that this man could get in here and kill Bainbridge? Kill him with what? Where's the weapon? - What? -Where's the weapon? Go on, search me, no weapon.
Bainbridge was on parade.
He came off duty five minutes ago.
When's this supposed to have happened? You obviously stabbed him before he got into the shower.
- No.
-No? He's soaking wet and there's still shampoo in his hair.
He got into the shower and then someone stabbed him.
But the cubicle was locked from the inside, sir.
I had to break it open.
Must have climbed over the top.
Well, then I'd be soaking wet, too, wouldn't I? Major, please.
I'm John Watson, Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers.
Three years in Afghanistan, a veteran of Kandahar, Helmand and Barts bloody Hospital! Let me examine this body! Thank you.
- Suicide? -No.
The weapon again, no knife.
Here we are.
There is a wound to the abdomen.
Incredibly fine.
Man stabbed to death.
No murder weapon.
Door locked from the inside.
Only one way in or out of here.
Sherlock.
-Mmm? - He's still breathing.
-Oh, my God.
- What do we do? -Give me your scarf.
- What? -Quickly, now.
-Call an ambulance.
-What? Call an ambulance now! Do it! Nurse, press here, hard.
- Nurse? -Yeah, I'm making do.
Keep pressure on that wound.
Steven? Steven, stay with me.
Private Bainbridge had just come off guard duty.
He'd stood there for hours, plenty of people watching, nothing apparently wrong.
He came off duty and within minutes was nearly dead from a wound in his stomach but there was no weapon.
Where did it go? Ladies and gentlemen, I invite you to consider this.
A murderer who can walk through walls.
A weapon that can vanish.
But in all of this, there is only one element which can be said to be truly remarkable.
Would anyone like to make a guess? Come on, come on.
There is actually an element of Q&A to all of this.
(CLEARING THROAT) Scotland Yard, have you got a theory? Yeah, you.
You're a detective, broadly speaking.
Got a theory? Er, um (STAMMERING) If the blade was propelled through the, urn grating in the air vent Maybe a ballista or a catapult, somebody tiny could crawl in there.
So yeah, we're looking for a dwarf.
- Brilliant.
-Really? No.
- Next.
-(WHISPERING) He stabbed himself.
Hello, who was that? Tom.
(CHAIR CREAKING) Got a theory? Um, attempted suicide with a blade made of compacted blood and bone.
Broke after piercing his abdomen, like a meat dagger.
- A meat dagger? -Yes.
Sit down.
No.
There was one feature and only one feature of interest in the whole of this baffling case and quite frankly, it was the usual.
John Watson.
Who, while I was trying to solve the murder, instead saved a life.
There are mysteries worth solving and stories worth telling.
The best and bravest man I know and on top of that he actually knows how to do stuff.
(LAUGHING) Except wedding planning and serviettes, he's rubbish at those.
(GUESTS CHUCKLING) The case itself remains the most ingenious and brilliantly planned murder or attempted murder I've ever had the pleasure to encounter.
The most perfect locked-room mystery of which I am aware.
However, I'm not just here to praise John, I'm also here embarrass him, so let's move on to some No, wait.
So how was it done? - How was what done? -The stabbing.
I'm afraid I don't know.
I didn't solve that one, that's It can happen sometimes.
It's very Very disappointing.
Embarrassment leads me on to the stag night.
Course, there's hours of material here, but I've cut it down to the really good bits.
Murder scenes.
Locations of murders? Mmm, pub crawl, themed.
Yeah, but why can't you just do Underground stations? It Lacks the personal touch.
We're going to go for a drink in In every street where you've found a corpse.
Delightful.
- Where do I come in? -Don't want to get ill.
That would ruin it, spoil the mood.
You're a graduate chemist, can't you just work it out? I like the practical experience.
Meaning you think I like a drink? - Occasionally.
- That I'm a drunk? No.
No! You look well.
- I am.
-How's Tom? - Not a sociopath.
-Still? Good.
And we're having quite a lot of sex.
Okay.
I want you to calculate John's ideal intake and mine to remain in the sweet spot the whole evening.
- Lightheaded good.
-Urinating in wardrobes bad.
Hmm.
Two, er, beers, please.
- Pints? - 443.
7 millilitres.
Ah (SIGHING) (CLEARING THROAT) - What, we're on a schedule? - You'll thank me.
- Cheers.
-Cheers.
- Over there.
-What? Toilets.
Any second now, you'll get Hang on.
Tell me after.
I need the loo.
Mmm.
On schedule.
- Eh? -Nothing.
Go.
-How long? -Sorry? Your visit.
If you could estimate approximate volume discharge Stop talking now.
Oh.
Quick, one more.
He mustn't see.
There you go.
Cheers.
I know Ash! Don't tell me I don't.
That is enough! That is Ashton.
SHERLOCK: I know Ashton! I have an international reputation.
Do you have an international reputation? No, I don't have an international reputation.
No.
And I can't even remember what for.
It's crime, something like that.
Oh.
What are you doing back? I thought you were going to be out late? SHERLOCK: Ah, Hudders.
What time is it? You've only been out two hours.
Am I a vegetable? You or the (LAUGHING) Funny.
- Thank you.
-Come on.
- No, you're not a vegetable.
-It's your go.
Uh Am I human? Sometimes.
Can't have sometimes.
Has to be, urn Yes, you're human.
Yes, I know.
And am I man? - Yep.
-Tall? Not as tall as people think.
Hmm.
Nice? - Ish.
- Clever? - I'd say so.
-You would.
Am I important? To some people.
Do "people" like me? Er, no, they don't.
You tend to rub them up the wrong way.
- Okay.
-(LAUGHING) Am I the current King of England? JOHN: We (LAUGHING) You know we don't have a king.
- Don't we? -No.
Your go.
I don't mind.
Am I a woman? (LAUGHING) What? Yes.
Am I pretty? This.
Beauty is a construct based entirely on childhood impressions, influences and role models.
Yeah, but am I a pretty lady? I don't know who you are.
I don't know who you're supposed to be.
You picked the name! Yeah, but] picked it at random from the papers.
You're not really getting the hang of this game, are you, Sherlock'! So I am human, I'm not as tall as people think I am.
I'm I'm nice-ish.
Clever.
Important to some people.
But I tend to rub them up the wrong way.
(LAUGHING) - Got it.
-Go on, then.
I'm you, aren't I? MRS HUDSON: (KNOCKING) Client! Client.
- Hello.
-Hello.
Come.
Which one of you is Sherlock Holmes? (WHISTLING) I don't a lot.
I mean, I don't date all that much and He seemed nice, you know? We seemed to automatically connect.
We had one night, dinner.
Such interesting conversation, it was lovely.
To be honest, I'd love to have gone further but I thought, "No, this is special.
"Let's take it slowly.
Exchange numbers.
" He said he'd get in touch and then Maybe he wasn't quite as keen as I was but I I just thought at least he'd call to say that we were finished.
I went round there.
To his flat.
No trace of him.
Mr Holmes, I honestly think I had dinner with a ghost.
(SHERLOCK MUMBLING) Mr Holmes? (FAINT SNORING) With a ghost, Mr Holmes! Boring.
Boring.
Boring.
No! Fascinating.
John,John, wake up.
Apologise about my, you know Rude.
Rude! I checked with the landlord and the man who lived there died.
Heart attack.
And there we are having dinner one week on.
And I found this thing online, sort of chat room thing, for girls who think they're dating men from the spirit world.
Don't worry.
I'll find him in 10 minutes.
What's your dog's name? JOHN: (MUMBLING) Yeah, I'll be there if you want John, wake up.
Meant to (SNAPS FINGERS) You The game is something - Oh.
-Yeah, that, that.
WOMAN: Okay.
Oh, it's nice.
Nice place.
- See amything? - Hmm? Any clues, Mr Holmes? Oh, er I'm just going to whip this out.
Mmm-hmm.
- You all right? -Hmm? - Yeah, he's clueing.
- What? He's Hmm? He's clueing for looks.
Mr Holmes? (SNORING) - Mr Holmes? -I'm calling the police.
Oh, no.
Whoa, whoa, whoa! This is a famous detective.
It's Sherlock Holmes and his partner, John Hamish Watson.
What do you think you're doing? Don't compromise the integrity of the (VOMITING) Crime scene.
Yeah, that.
(SIGHING) - LESTRADE: Wakey, wakey! -Oh, my God.
Greg? Is that Greg? Get up, I'm going to put you two in a taxi.
Managed to square things with the desk sergeant.
(CHUCKLING) What a couple of lightweights.
You couldn't even make it to closing time.
-Can you whisper? -(SHOUTING) Not really! Come on.
Well, thanks for, you know, -an evening.
-It was awful.
- Yep.
-Oh.
I was going to pretend but It was, truly.
- That woman Tessa -What? Dated a ghost, most interesting case for months.
What a wasted opportunity.
Okay.
- MRS HUDSON: How are you feeling? -Mmm.
It's just like old times, having you back here.
I thought I'd make your favourite.
- One last time.
-Oh.
(CLEARING THROAT) Don't sound so final about it.
I will be visiting, you know.
Oh, I've heard that one before.
No, it's different now, though, isn't it? It's different to when we thought we'd lost him.
Well, marriage changes everything, John.
- Does it? -Yeah.
You might not think it but it does.
It's a different phase in your life.
You meet new people 'cause you're a couple.
And then you just let your old friends slip away.
It won't be like that.
Well, if you've found the right one, the person that you click with, it's the best thing in the world.
Well, I have.
I know I have.
Oh, I'm sure.
She's lovely.
Yeah, I think so.
- What about you? -Me? Did you think you'd found the right one when you married Mr Hudson? No.
It was just a whirlwind thing for us.
I knew it wouldn't work -but I just got sort of swept along.
-Right.
And then we moved to Florida.
We had a fantastic time but of course, I didn't know what he was up to.
- The drugs.
-Drugs? He was running, urn Oh, God, what do you call it? Um, a cartel.
- And got in with a really bad crowd.
-Right.
And then I found out about all the other women.
I didn't have a clue.
So when he was actually arrested for blowing someone's head off, it was quite a relief, to be honest.
Right.
It was purely physical between me and Frank.
We couldn't keep our hands off each other.
And, um, there was one night Oh, is that Sherlock? Is it? (FAINT FOOTSTEPS) No, it's Sherlock.
(GROANING) (APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS) (SHERLOCK CLEARING THROAT) There are going to be others.
- Others? -Victims.
Women.
Most ghosts tend to haunt a single house.
This ghost, however, is willing to commute.
Look.
Mmmnot you.
Not you.
Not you.

- Hi.
-Gail.
Charlotte.
Robyn.
Vicky.
How did you meet? Came up to me in a pub.
Same gym as me.
We just got chatting on the bus.
Online.
- Name? -Told you.
His name.
-Oscar.
-Mike.
Terry.
Urn, Love Monkey.
- Your place? -WOMEN: His place.
Address? (VOICES OVERLAPPING) Nothing happened.
It was just very romantic.
Four women in four nights.
He must have something special.
- He was very charming.
-Innocent.
He was sweet.
- He a lovely -You okay? (COMPUTER BEEPING) Let your food go cold.
Mrs Hudson will play hell.
Not now, John.
- Sorry about that.
-(COMPUTER BEEPS) He had a lovely manner.
Different names, different addresses.
- Describe him.
-Short blond hair.
Dark hair.
Long.
Ginger.
I like gingers.
Couldn't tell.
He had a mask on.
SHERLOCK: He's stealing the identity of corpses, getting their names from the obituary columns.
All single men.
He's using the dead man's flat under the assumption it'll be empty for a while.
Free love nest.
- I feel sick.
-It's gruesome.
- That's awful.
-Clever.
Bastard.
(CHIMING) SHERLOCK: Hello, Tessa.
Meanwhile, back to business.
No one wants to use a dead man's home.
At least not until it's been cleared, so he disguises himself, steals the man's home, steals his identity.
But only for one night.
- And he's gone.
-He's not a ghost, John.
He's a mayfly.
He lives for a day.
So what was it he was looking for? Job? - Gardener.
-Cook.
- Private nurse.
-I do security work.
Maid.
Obvious.
You all work for the same person.
No, no.
Not the same employer.
Damn! Come on, we can do this.
Ideal night out? -Clay pigeon shooting.
-Line dancing.
- Pictures.
-Wine in front of the telly.
Dungeon.
- Makeup? - Clarins.
- No7.
- Maybelline.
- Nothing special.
-Whatever's cheap.
Perfume? -Chanel.
-Chanel.
-Chanel.
-Chanel.
Este Lauder.
Ideal man? - George Clooney.
-Oh, no.
Home-loving.
He'd have to like cuddling.
Caring.
Ten things.
One, someone who isn't competitive with other men.
Two, someone who isn't constantly trying to define himself by his masculinity.
There's a unifying factor, there has to be.
None of you reported anything stolen.
Security guard, gardener, cook, maid, private nurse.
He's romancing his way up the pecking order, somebody's pecking order.
Come on, think.
Unless Do you have a secret you've never told anyone? WOMEN: No.
- Gotcha.
-What do you mean? Everyone has secrets and they all replied too quickly.
- Got to go.
-See you.
- No, wait.
-Bye-bye.
Sorry, sexy, some secrets have to stay secret.
Enjoy the wedding.
Yeah.
Why? Why would he date all of those women and not return their calls? You're missing the obvious, mate.
- Am I? -He's a man.
Why would he change his identity? Maybe he's married.
Oh.
Married.
Obvious, really.
Our mayfly man was trying to escape the suffocating chains of domesticity and instead of endless nights in watching the telly or going to barbeques with the awful, dreadful, boring people he couldn't stand, he used his wits, cleverness and powers of disguise to play the field.
He was On second thoughts, I probably should have told you about The Elephant in the Room.
However, it does help to further illustrate how invaluable John is to me.
I can read a crime scene the way he can understand a human being.
I used to think that's what made me special.
Quite frankly, I still do.
But a word to the wise.
Should any of you require the services of either of us, I will solve your murder but it takes John Watson to save your life.
Trust me on that.
I should know.
He's saved mine so many times and in so many ways.
This blog is the story of two men and their frankly ridiculous adventures.
-(GUESTS CHUCKLING) -Of murder, mystery and mayhem.
But from now on, there's a new story.
A bigger adventure.
Ladies and gentlemen, pray charge your glasses and be upstanding.
Today begin the adventures of Mary Elizabeth Watson and John Hamish Watson.
(GIGGLING) The two reasons why every single one of us is (SHUTTER CLICKING) (SHUTTER CLICKING) (SHUTTER CLICKING) What did you say? You said, "John Hamish Watson.
" You said that, you said Hamish.
This is a famous detective, it's Sherlock Holmes and his partner, John Hamish Watson.
How did you know? How did you know his middle name? Never tells anyone, he hates it.
John H Watson? Yep.
- Henry? -Shut up.
- Humphrey? -Shut up.
(SHOWER RUNNING) -Higgins? -JOHN: Go away! Took him years to confide in me.
(SIGHING) That's my birth certificate.
Yep.
And the woman, she knew.
Hamish.
(CLEARING THROAT) John Hamish Watson.
Just if you were looking for baby names.
God knows where she is.
Out of my head, I am busy! There's only one time that name's been made public.
JOHN: Does it have to be on the invitation? It's your name.
- It's traditional.
-It's funny.
TESSA: Enjoy the wedding.
Enjoy the wedding.
The wedding! You knew about the wedding.
More importantly, you'd seen the wedding invitation.
Now, barely a hundred people had seen that invitation.
The Mayfly Man only saw five women.
For one person to be in both groups could be a coincidence.
MYCROFT: Oh, Sherlock.
What do we say about coincidence? The universe is rarely so lazy.
So, the balance of probability is Someone went to great lengths to find out something about this wedding.
- What great lengths? -They lied.
Assumed false identities.
- Which suggests? -Criminal intent.
- Also suggests -Intelligence.
Planning.
Clearly.
But more importantly The Mayfly Man.
The Mayfly Man is -here today.
-(GLASS SHATTERING) Ooh, sorry, I (CLEARING THROAT) WAITER: Another glass, sir? Thank you, yes.
Thank you, yes.
Something is going to happen, right here.
Now, where were we? Could be any second.
You have control of the room.
Ah, yes, raising glasses and standing up.
Very good, thank you.
Don't lose it.
And down again.
(GUESTS MUTTERING) Ladies and gentlemen, people tell you not to milk a good speech.
Get off early, leave them laughing.
Wise advice I'll certainly try to bear in mind but for now Part two! Part two is more action-based.
I'm going to walk around, shake things up a bit.
Who'd go to a wedding? That's the question.
Who would bother to go to any lengths to get themselves to a wedding? Well, everyone.
Weddings are great! Love a wedding.
- What's he doing? -Something's wrong.
And John's great, too.
I haven't said that enough, barely scratched the surface.
I could go on all night about the depth and complexity of his - WOMAN: jumpers.
-jumpers, and he can cook Does a thing, thing with peasonce.
Might not be peas, might not be him.
But he's got a great singing voice or somebody does Too many, too many, too many, too many! Sorry, too many jokes about John.
Now, uh Criminal intent.
Where was I? Ah, yes.
Extraordinary lengths.
Speech! Speech.
Let's talk about All of which is suggestive of - Murder.
-(GROANING) Sorry, did I say "murder"? I meant to say "marriage".
But, you know, they're quite similar procedures, when you think about it, the participants tend to know each other and it's over when one of them's dead.
In fairness, murder is a lot quicker, though.
Janine, what about this one? Acceptably hot? More importantly, his girlfriend's wearing brand-new, uncomfortable underwear and hasn't bothered to pick this thread off of the top of his jacket or point out the grease smudge on the back of his neck.
Currently, he's going home alone.
Also, he's a comics and sci-fi geek, they're always tremendously grateful when you put the hours in.
-(GASPS) -Geoff, the gents.
- The loos, now, please.
-Greg.
- The loos, please.
-(MOBILE BEEPS) - Why? -Oh, I don't know, maybe it's your turn.
Yeah, actually, now you mention it JOHN: Sherlock, any chance of an end date for this speech? Gotta cut the cake.
Oh! Ladies and gentlemen, can't stand it when I finally get the chance to speak for once, - Vatican Cameos.
-What did he say? What does that mean? Battle stations, someone's going to die.
What? Narrow it down.
Narrow it down.
Narrow it down.
No! No! Not you, not you.
You.
It's always you.
John Watson, you keep me right.
- What do I do? -You've already done it.
Don't solve the murder, save the life.
(INHALING) Sorry.
Off-piste a bit, back now, phew! Let's play a game.
Let's play Murder.
MRS HUDSON: Sherlock! Imagine someone's going to get murdered at a wedding.
Who exactly would you pick? I think you're a popular choice at the moment, dear.
If someone could move Mrs Hudson's glass just slightly out of reach, that would be lovely.
More importantly, who could you only kill at a wedding? Most people you can kill any old place.
As a mental exercise, I have often planned the murder of friends and colleagues.
Now, John I'd poison.
Sloppy eater, dead easy.
I've given him chemicals and compounds that way, he's never even noticed.
He missed a whole Wednesday once, didn't have a clue.
Lestrade's so easy to kill, it's a miracle no one's succumbed to the temptation.
I've got a pair of keys to my brother's house, I could easily break in there and asphyxiate him If the whim arose.
He's pissed, isn't he? Ow! So, once again, who could you only kill here? Clearly, it's a rare opportunity, so it's someone who doesn't get out much.
Someone for whom a planned social encounter known about months in advance is an exception.
Has to be a unique opportunity.
And since killing someone in public is difficult, killing them in private isn't an option.
Someone who lives in an inaccessible or unknown location, then.
Someone private, perhaps, obsessed with personal security -(BEEPING) -Possibly someone under threat.
Major James Sholto, who he? - I don't think he's coming.
-He'll be there.
- Where are you living these days? -Oh, way out in the middle of nowhere.
The press and the family's giving him hell, he gets more death threats than you.
Oh, a recluse? Small household staff.
- Job? -Gardener, cook, private nurse, maid.
High turnover for additional security.
I do security work.
Probably all signed confidentiality agreements.
Do you have a secret you've never told anyone? - ALL: No.
-There's another question that remains, however, rather a big one, a huge one.
How would you do it? How do you kill someone in public? There has to be a way.
- This has been planned.
-Mr Holmes, Mr Holmes! Oh, hello again, Archie.
What's your theory? Get this right and there's a headless nun in it for you.
The invisible man could do it.
The who, the what, the when, the why, the where? The invisible man with the invisible knife, the one who tried to kill the guardsman.
Bainbridge? Bainbridge! Oh, not just planned, planned and rehearsed.
Ladies and gentlemen, there will now be a short interlude.
To the bride and groom! GUESTS: To the bride and the groom.
Major Sholto's going to be murdered.
I don't know how or by whom but it's going to happen.
Excuse me, coming through, consulting.
- Stay here.
-Please be careful.
Excuse me, coming through.
Excuse me.
Sorry, one moment.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
What's happening? What's going on? How can you not remember which room? You remember everything! - I have to delete something! - 207! (KNOCKING) Major Sholto? Major Sholto? Major Sholto! If someone's about to make an attempt on my life, it won't be the first time.
I'm ready.
Major, let us in! - Kick the door down.
-SHOLTO: I really wouldn't.
I have a gun in my hand and a lifetime of unfortunate reflexes.
You're not safe in there.
Whoever's after you, we know that a locked room doesn't stop him.
The invisible man with the invisible knife? I don't know how he does it so I can't stop him and that means he'll do it again.
Solve it, then.
I I'm sorry? SHOLTO: You're the famous Mr Holmes.
Solve the case, on you go.
Tell me how he did it and I'll open the door.
Please, this is no time for games.
just let us in, you're in danger! So are you, so long as you're here.
Please, leave me.
Despite my reputation, I really don't approve of collateral damage.
- Solve it.
-Sorry? Solve it and he'll open the door, like he said.
I couldn't solve it before, how can I solve it now? - Because it matters now! -What are you talking about? What's she talking about? Get your wife under control.
JOHN: She's right.
- Oh, you've changed.
-No, she is.
Shut up.
You are not a puzzle solver, you never have been.
You're a drama queen.
Now, there is a man in there about to die, the game is on, solve it! (CLINKING) (SIZZLING) -(SHOWER RUNNING) -Bainbridge? (KNOCKING) Bainbridge! Though, in fairness, -he's a drama queen, too.
-Yeah, I know.
Major Sholto, no one's coming to kill you.
I'm afraid you've already been killed several hours ago.
- What did you say? -Don't take off your belt.
My belt? His belt, yes.
Bainbridge was stabbed hours before we even saw him, -but it was through his belt.
-(CLICKING) Tight belt, worn high on the waist.
Very easy to push a small blade through the fabric, and you wouldn't even feel it.
The belt would bind the flesh together -when it was tight.
-Exactly.
- And when you took it off -Delayed action stabbing.
All the time in the world to create an alibi.
Major Sholto! So I was to be killed by my uniform.
How appropriate.
He solved the case, Major, you're supposed to open the door now.
A deal is a deal.
I'm not even supposed to have this any more.
They gave me special dispensation to keep it.
I couldn't imagine life out of this uniform, I suppose, given the circumstances, I don't have to.
When so many want you dead, it hardly seems good manners to argue.
Whatever you're doing in there, James, stop it right now.
I will kick this door down.
SHOLTO: Mr Holmes, you and I are similar, I think.
Yes, I think we are.
There's a proper time to die, isn't there? Of course there is.
And one should embrace it when it comes.
Like a soldier.
Of course one should but not at John's wedding! We wouldn't do that, would we, you and me? We would never do that to John Watson.
- I'm going to break it down.
-Wait, wait, you won't have to.
Hmm? I believe I am in need of medical attention.
I believe I'm your doctor.
(CLASSICAL WALTZ PLAYING) (HUMMING) Yeah, pretty good, just - Hold your nerve when you're turning.
-Why do we have to rehearse? Because we are about to dance together in public and your skills are appalling.
(LAUGHING) - Well, you're a good teacher.
-Hmm.
And you're a brilliant dancer.
- I'll let you in on something, Janine.
-Go on, then.
- I love dancing.
I've always loved it.
Seriously? Watch out.
Oh! (CLEARING THROAT) That rarely comes up in crime work but, you know, I live in hope of the right case.
(SIGHING) I wish you weren't whatever it is you are.
- I know.
-Well! Glad to see you've pulled, Sherlock, what with murderers running riot at my wedding.
One murder One nearly murderer.
He loves to exaggerate.
You should try living with him.
Sherlock.
- Got him for you.
-Ah! The photographer, excellent.
Thank you.
Um, may I have a look at your camera? Uh, what's this about? I was halfway home.
- You should have driven faster.
-(BEEPING) Ah, yes.
Yes! Very good! There, you see? Perfect.
What is? You going to tell us? Try looking yourself.
Who? For what? Is the murderer in these photographs? It's not what's in the photographs, it's what's not in them.
Not in any of them.
Sherlock, the showing-off thing, we've discussed it before.
There is always a man at a wedding who is not in any photograph, who can go anywhere, even carry an equipment bag around with him if he likes.
And you never even see his face.
You only ever see the camera.
What are you doing? What is this? Jonathan Small, today's substitute wedding photographer, known to us as the Mayfly Man.
His brother was one of the raw recruits killed in that incursion.
Johnny sought revenge on Sholto, worked his way through Sholto's staff, found what he needed.
An invitation to a wedding.
The one time Sholto would have to be out in public.
So, he made his plan and rehearsed the murder, making sure of every last detail.
Brilliant, ruthless and almost certainly a monomaniac.
Though, in fairness, his photographs are actually quite good.
Everything you need's on that.
You probably ought to arrest him or something.
- Do you always carry handcuffs? -Down, girl.
Come on, quick.
It's not me you should be arresting, Mr Holmes.
Oh, I don't do the arresting, I just farm that out.
Sholto, he's the killer, not me.
I should have killed him quicker.
I shouldn't have tried to be clever.
You should have driven faster.
Right.
(VIOLIN PLAYING) (GASPS) Really? (BOTH LAUGHING) Whoo! Yeah! Whoo! Ladies and gentlemen, just one last thing before the evening begins properly.
Apologies for earlier, a crisis arose and was dealt with.
More importantly, however, today we saw two people make vows.
I have never made a vow in my life and after tonight I never will again.
So, here in front of you all, my first and last vow.
Mary and John Whatever it takes, whatever happens, from now on, I swear I will always be there, always, for all three of you.
Uh, I'm sorry, I mean two of you.
All two of you.
Both of you, in fact, I just miscounted.
Anyway, it's time for dancing.
Play the music again, please.
Thank you.
Okay everybody, just dance.
Don't be shy.
- (DECEMBER 1963 (OH WHAT A NIGHT) PLAYS) - Dancing, please! Very good! Sorry, that was one more deduction than I was really expecting.
- Deduction? -Increased appetite.
- I'm starving! -Change of taste perception.
Ugh, I chose this wine.
It's bloody awful! You were sick this morning.
You assumed it was just wedding nerves.
You got angry with me when I mentioned it to you.
All the signs are there.
The signs? - The signs of three.
-What? Mary, I think you should do a pregnancy test.
(SHERLOCK MUMBLES) The statistics for the first trimester are Shut up! - Just shut up.
-Sorry.
How did he notice before me? I'm a bloody doctor.
- It's your day off.
-It's your day oh? - Stop panicking.
-I'm not panicking.
I'm pregnant, I'm panicking.
Don't panic.
None of you panic.
Absolutely no reason to panic.
- Oh, and you'd know, of course? -Yes, I would.
You're already the best parents in the world, look at all the practice you've had.
The practice? Well, you're hardly going to need me around now that you've got a real baby on the way.
- JOHN: Are you all right? -Yeah! - Dance! -Hmm? Both of you now, go, dance.
We can??t just stand here, people will wonder what we're talking about.
- Right.
-What about you? Well, we can't all three dance, there are limits.
- Yes, there are.
-(CLEARING THROAT) Come on, husband, let's go.
- This isn't a waltz, is it? -No.
Don't worry, Mary, I have been tutoring him.
He did, you know.
Baker Street, behind closed curtains.
Mrs Hudson came in one time.
Don't know how those rumours started.
Mr Magnussen, please state your full name for the record.
Charles Augustus Magnussen.
Mr Magnussen, how would you describe your influence over the Prime Minister? The British Prime Minister? Any of the British Prime Ministers you have known.
I never had the slightest influence over any of them.
Why would I? I notice you've had seven meetings at Downing Street this year.
Why? Because I was invited.
Can you recall the subjects under discussion? Not without being more indiscreet than I believe is appropriate.
Do you think it right that a newspaper proprietor, a private individual, and in fact a foreign national, should have such regular access to our Prime Minister? I don't think it's wrong that a private individual should accept an invitation.
However, you have my sincere apologies for being foreign.
That's not what I meant.
That is not in any way Mr Magnussen, can you recall an occasion when your remarks could have influenced government policy? Or the Prime Minister's thinking in any way? No.
Are you sure? I have an excellent memory.
Your car is waiting outside See you tomorrow.
May I join you? I don't think it's appropriate.
It isn't.
Mr Magnussen, outside the inquiry, we can have no contact, no communication at all.
Please don't do that.
In 1982, your husband corresponded with Helen Catherine Driscoll.
That was before I knew him.
The letters were lively, loving some would say explicit.
And currently in my possession.
Will you please move your hand? "I long, my darling, to know the touch of your body.
" I know what was in the letters.
She was 15.
She looked older.
Oh, she looked delicious.
We have photographs too.
The ones she sent him.
Yum-yum.
He was unaware of her age.
He met her only once before the letters began.
When he discovered the truth, he stopped immediately.
Those are the facts.
Facts are for history books.
I work in news.
Your hand is sweating.
Always, I'm afraid.
I have a condition.
It's disgusting.
I'm used to it.
The whole world is wet to my touch.
I will call someone, I will have you removed.
What is that? Claire de la Lune? A bit young for you, isn't it? You want to hit me now? Could you, still? Little old lady now.
Perhaps you should settle for calling someone.
Well, go on.
No? Because now there are consequences.
I have the letters and therefore I have you.
This is blackmail.
Of course it isn't blackmail.
This is ownership.
You do not own me.
Claire de la Lune.
It never tastes like it smells, does it? Lady Smallwood's bill is on me.
See to it.
Yes, Mr Magnussen.
Oh, God! Oh! You all right, ma'am? Fine, yes.
Magnussen! No-one stands up to him.
No-one dares, no-one even tries.
There isn't a man or woman in England capable of stopping that disgusting creature Ma'am? Turn the car around.
We're going back into town.
Turn around.
Where are we going, ma'am? Baker Street.
'You've seen a lot of injuries, then? Violent deaths?' 'Enough for a lifetime.
' 'Want to see some more?' 'Oh, God, yes.
' 'The game is on.
' I know it's early.
Really, I'm sorry.
Is that Kate? Yeah, it's Kate.
Invite her in? Er, sorry, yes, do you want to come in, Kate? Hey! It's hard.
There you go.
It's Isaac.
Oh, your husband? Son.
Son, yeah.
He's gone missing again.
Didn't come home last night.
The usual.
He's the drugs one, yeah? Er, yeah, nicely put, John.
But is it Sherlock Holmes you want? Because I've not seen him in ages.
About a month.
Who is Sherlock Holmes? See, that does happen.
There's a place they all go to, him and his friends.
They all do whatever they do.
Shoot up, whatever you call it.
Where is he? It's a house, it's a dump.
It's practically falling down.
No, the address? Where, exactly? Seriously? Why not? She's not going to the police, someone's got to get him.
Why you? I'm being neighbourly.
Since when? Ha, since now.
Since this exact minute.
Why are you being so? What? I don't know, what's the matter with you? There is NOTHING the matter with me.
Imagine I said that without shouting.
I'm trying.
No, you can't come, you're pregnant.
You can't go, I'm pregnant! What is that?! It's a tyre lever.
Why? Cos there were loads of smackheads in there and one of them might need help with a tyre.
If there's any trouble, just go, I'll be fine.
John, John, John, John It is a tiny bit sexy.
Yeah, I know.
Hello? What do you want? Excuse me.
Oh, no, you can't come in here! I'm looking for a friend.
A very specific friend.
I'm not just browsing.
You've got to go.
No-one's allowed here.
Isaac Whitney, you seen him? I'm asking you if you've seen Isaac Whitney and now you're showing me a knife.
Is it a clue? Are you doing a mime? Go.
Or I'll cut you.
Oh, not from there.
Let me help.
Now, concentrate.
Isaac Whitney? OK, you asked for it.
Agh! Ohh! Right.
Are you concentrating yet? You broke my arm! No, I sprained it.
It feels squishy.
Is it supposed to feel squishy? Feel that! Yeah, it's a sprain.
I'm a doctor, I know how to sprain people.
Now where is Isaac Whitney? I don't know! Maybe upstairs.
There you go.
Wasn't that easy? No, it was really sore.
Mental, you are! No, just used to a better class of criminal.
Isaac? Isaac Whitney? Isaac? Hello, mate.
Sit up for me, sit up.
Dr Watson? Yep.
Where am I? Arse-end of the universe with the scum of the earth.
Look at me.
Have you come for me? Do you think I know a lot of people here? Hey, all right? Oh, hello, John.
Didn't expect to see you here.
Come for me too? Hello, Isaac.
Mrs Watson, can I, can I get in, please? Yes, of course, get in.
Where's John? They're having a fight.
Who is?! For God sakes, John, I'm on a case! A month.
That's all it took.
One! I'm working.
"Sherlock Holmes in a drug den.
" How's that going to look?! I'm undercover.
No, you're not! Well, I'm not now! In, both of you, quickly! Please, can I come? I think I've got a broken arm.
No, go away.
No, let him.
Why? Yeah, just get in.
It's a sprain.
Anyone else? I mean, are we taking everybody home, are we? All right, Shezza? "Shezza"? I WAS undercover! Seriously, Shezza, though? We're not going home, we're going to Bart's.
I'm calling Molly.
Why? Because Sherlock Holmes needs to pee in a jar.
Well? Is he clean? Clean? How dare you throw away the beautiful gifts you were born with! And how dare you betray the love of your friends! Say you're sorry.
Sorry your engagement's over.
Though I'm fairly grateful for the lack of a ring.
Stop it.
Just stop it! If you were anywhere near this kind of thing again, you could have called, you could have talked to me.
Please, do relax.
This is all for a case.
What kind of case would need you doing this? I might as well ask you why you've started cycling to work? No, we're not playing this game.
Quite recently, I'd say, you're very determined about it.
Not interested.
I am.
Ow! Oh, sorry, you moved, but it is just a sprain.
Yeah, somebody hit me.
Huh? Yeah, just some guy.
Yeah, it was probably just an addict in need of a fix.
Yes, I think in a way it was.
Is it his shirt? I'm sorry? Well, it's the creases, isn't it? The two creases down the front.
It's been recently folded, but it's not new.
You must have dressed in a hurry this morning.
So all your shirts must be kept like that.
But why? Maybe cos you cycle to work every morning, shower when you get there and then dress in the clothes you brought with you.
You keep your shirts folded, ready to pack.
Not bad.
And I further deduce you've only started recently because you've got a bit of chafing.
No, he's always walked like that.
Remind me, what's your name again? They call me the Wig.
No, they don't.
Well, they they call me Wiggy.
Nope.
Bill.
Bill Wiggins.
Nice observational skills, Billy.
Ah, finally! Finally what? Good news? Oh, excellent news, the best.
There's every chance that my drug habit might hit the newspapers.
The game is on.
Excuse me for a second.
You've heard of Charles Augustus Magnussen, of course? Yeah.
Owns some newspapers.
Ones I don't read.
Hang on, weren't there other people? Mary's taking the boys home, I'm taking you, we did discuss it.
People were talking, none of them were me, I must have filtered.
I noticed.
I have to filter out a lot of witless babble.
I've got Mrs Hudson on semi-permanent mute.
What is my brother doing here? So I'll just pay, then, shall I? He's straightened the knocker.
He always corrects it, it's OCD, doesn't even know he's doing it.
Why do you do that? Do what? Nothing.
Well then, Sherlock, back on the sauce? What are you doing here? I phoned him.
The siren call of old habits.
How very like Uncle Rudy.
Though in many ways, cross-dressing would have been a wiser path for you.
You phoned him.
Of course I bloody phoned him.
Of course he bloody did.
Now save me a little time - where should we be looking? "We"? Mr Holmes? For God's sake! Anderson?! Sorry, Sherlock, it's for your own good.
Oh, that's him, isn't it? You said he'd be taller.
Some members of your little fan club.
Do be polite.
They're entirely trustworthy and even willing to search through the toxic waste dump that you are pleased to call a flat.
You're a celebrity these days, Sherlock.
You can't afford a drug habit.
- I do not have a drug habit.
- Hey, what happened to my chair? It was blocking my view to the kitchen.
Well, it's good to be missed! You were gone, I saw an opportunity.
No, you saw the kitchen.
What have you found so far? Clearly, nothing.
There's nothing to find! Your bedroom door is shut.
You haven't been home all night.
So, why would a man who has never knowingly closed a door without the direct orders of his mother bother to do so on this occasion? OK, stop, just stop! Point made.
Jesus, Sherlock! I shall have to phone our parents, of course.
In Oklahoma.
It won't be the first time that your substance abuse has wreaked havoc with their line dancing.
This is not what you think.
This is for a case.
What case could possibly justify this? Magnussen.
Charles Augustus Magnussen.
That name you think you may have just heard, you were mistaken.
If you ever mention hearing that name in this room, in this context, I guarantee you, on behalf of the British Security Services, that materials will be found on your computer hard-drives, resulting in your immediate incarceration.
Don't reply, just look frightened and scuttle.
I hope I won't have to threaten you as well.
Well, I think we'd both find that embarrassing.
Magnussen is not your business.
Oh, you mean he's yours? You may consider him under my protection.
I consider you under his thumb.
If you go against Magnussen, then you will find yourself going against me.
OK.
I'll let you know if I notice.
Um, what was I going to say? Oh, yeah.
Bye-bye.
Unwise, brother mine.
Ohh! Ugh! Brother mine don't appal me when I'm high.
Mycroft, don't say another word, just go.
He could snap you in two and right now, I'm slightly worried that he might.
Don't speak, just leave.
Oh.
Er, Magnussen? What time is it? About eight.
I'll be meeting him in three hours.
I need a bath.
It's for a case, you say? Yep.
What sort of case? Too big and dangerous for any sane individual to get involved in.
You trying to put me off? God, no.
Trying to recruit you.
And stay out of my bedroom.
Oh, John, hi.
How are you? Janine? Sorry, not dressed.
Has everybody gone? I heard shouting.
Yes, they're gone.
God, look at the time.
I'll be late.
It sounded like an argument.
Was it Mike? Mike? Mike, yeah.
His brother, Mike.
They're always fighting.
Mycroft.
Do people actually call him that? Yeah.
Huh! Oh, could you be a love and put some coffee on? Sure, right, yeah.
Thanks.
Oh, how is Mary? How's married life? She's fine.
We're both fine.
Yeah.
Oh, it's over there now.
Where's Sherl? (Sherl!) Er, he's just having a bath.
I'm sure he'll be out in a minute.
Oh, like he ever is! Yeah.
Morning.
Room for a little one? Morning.
Ooh! So, it's just a guess, but you've probably got some questions? Yeah, one or two.
Pretty much.
Naturally.
You have a girlfriend? Yes, I have.
Now, Magnussen.
Magnussen is like a shark.
It's the only way I can describe him.
Have you ever been to the shark tank at the London Aquarium, John? Stood up close to the glass? Those floating, flat faces, those dead eyes.
That's what he is.
I've dealt with murderers, psychopaths, terrorists, serial killers.
None of them can turn my stomach like Charles Augustus Magnussen.
Yes, you have? Sorry, what? You have a girlfriend? What? Yes, yes, I'm going out with Janine.
I thought that was fairly obvious.
Yes.
Well, yes.
You You You are in a relationship? Yes, I am.
You and Janine? Hmm.
Yes, me and Janine.
Care to elaborate? Well, we're in a good place.
It's, um very affirming.
You got that from a book.
Everyone got that from a book.
OK, you two bad boys.
Behave yourselves.
You, Sherl, you're going to have to tell me where you were last night.
Working.
Working? Of course.
I'm the only one who really knows what you're like, remember? Well, don't you go letting on.
I might just, actually.
I haven't told Mary about this.
I kind of wanted to surprise her.
Yeah, I think you probably will.
But we should have you two over for dinner, really soon.
Yeah.
My place though, not the scuzz-dump.
Great, yeah.
Dinner, yeah.
I'd better dash.
It was brilliant to see you.
You too.
Have a lovely day.
Call me later.
I might do.
I might call you.
Unless I meet someone prettier.
Solve me a crime, Sherlock Holmes.
You know Magnussen as a newspaper owner, but he is so much more than that.
He uses his power and wealth to gain information.
The more he acquires, the greater his wealth and power.
And I'm not exaggerating when I say that he knows the critical pressure point on every person of note or influence in the whole of the Western World and probably beyond.
He is the Napoleon of blackmail.
And he has created an unassailable architecture of forbidden knowledge.
Its name is Appledore.
Dinner? Sorry, what dinner? Me and Mary coming for dinner with wine and sitting.
Seriously? I have just told you that the Western World is run from this house and you want to talk about dinner? Fine.
Talk about the house.
It is the greatest repository of sensitive and dangerous information anywhere in the world, the Alexandrian Library of secrets and scandals and none of it is on a computer.
He's smart.
Computers can be hacked.
It's all on hard copy, in vaults, underneath that house.
And as long as it is, the personal freedom of anyone you've ever met is a fantasy.
That was the doorbell.
Couldn't you hear it? It's in the fridge.
It kept ringing.
Oh, that's not a fault, Sherlock! Who is it? Mr Holmes said you can go right up.
Oh.
Go ahead.
Sir? Can I have a moment? He's fine.
Look, I Right.
I should probably tell you OK, I There.
Doesn't mean I'm not pleased to see you.
I can vouch for this man.
He is a doctor.
If you know who I am, then you know who he is.
Don't you, Mr Magnussen? I understood we were meeting at YOUR office.
This is my office.
Well, it is now.
Mr Magnussen, I have been asked to intercede with you by Lady Elizabeth Smallwood on the matter of her husband's letters.
Some time ago you put pressure on her concerning those letters.
She would like those letters back.
Obviously, the letters no longer have any practical use to you, so with that in mind Something I said? No, no.
I was reading.
There's rather a lot.
Redbeard? Sorry.
Sorry, you were probably talking.
I I was trying to explain that I have been asked to act on behalf of Bathroom? Along from the kitchen, sir.
OK.
I've been asked to negotiate the return of those letters.
I am aware you do not make copies of sensitive documents.
Is it like the rest of the flat? Sir? The bathroom? Yes, sir.
Maybe not then.
Am I acceptable to you as an intermediary? Lady Elizabeth Smallwood I like her.
Mr Magnussen, am I acceptable to you as an intermediary? She's English with a spine.
Best thing about the English you're so domesticated.
All standing around, apologising keeping your little heads down.
You can do what you like here.
No-one's ever going to stop you.
A nation of herbivores.
I have interests all over the world but everything starts in England.
If it works here I try it in a real country.
The United Kingdom, Petri dish to the Western World.
Tell Lady Elizabeth I might need those letters so I'm keeping them.
Goodbye.
Anyway they're funny.
Jesus! Did you notice the one extraordinary thing he did? There was a moment that kind of stuck in the mind, yeah.
Exactly.
When he showed us the letters.
OK.
So, he's brought the letters to London, so no matter what he says, he's ready to make a deal.
Now, Magnussen only makes a deal once he's established a person's weaknesses, the pressure point, he calls it.
So, clearly he believes I'm a drug addict and no serious threat.
And of course, because he's in town tonight, the letters will be in his safe in his London office while he's out to dinner with the Marketing Group of GB from seven till ten.
How do you know his schedule? Because I do.
I'll see you tonight.
I've got some shopping to do.
What's tonight? I'll text instructions.
Yeah, I'll text YOU if I'm available.
You are, I checked.
Don't bring a gun.
Why would I bring a gun? Or a knife or a tyre lever.
Probably best not to do any arm-spraining, but we'll see how the night goes.
Are you just assuming I'm coming along? Time you got out of the house, John.
You've put on 7lbs since you married and the cycling isn't doing it.
It's actually 4lbs.
Mary and I think seven.
See you later.
And breaking news now.
John Garvie MP has been arrested today on charges of corruption.
This follows an investigation Magnussen's office is on the top floor, just below his private flat.
There are 14 layers of security between us and him, two of which aren't even legal in this country.
Want to know how we're going to break in? Is that what we're doing? Of course it's what we're doing.
Magnussen's private lift.
Goes straight to his penthouse and office.
Only he uses it and only his keycard calls the lift.
If anyone else even tries, security is automatically informed.
Standard keycard for the building.
Nicked it yesterday.
Only gets us as far as the canteen.
Here we go then.
If I was to use this card on that lift now, what happens? Well, the alarms would go off and you'd be dragged away by security.
Exactly.
Get taken to a small room somewhere and your head kicked in.
Do we really need so much colour? It passes the time.
But if I do this If you press a keycard against your mobile phone for long enough, it corrupts the magnetic strip.
The card stops working.
It's a common problem.
Never put your keycard with your phone.
What happens if I use the card now? It still doesn't work.
But it doesn't read as the wrong card now.
It registers as corrupted.
But if it's corrupted, how do they know it's not Magnussen? Would they risk dragging him off? Probably not.
So, what do they do? What do they have to do? Check if it's him or not.
There's a camera at eye height to the right of the door.
A live picture of the card user is relayed directly to Magnussen's personal staff in his office, the only people trusted to make a positive ID.
At this hour, almost certainly his PA.
So, how does that help us? Human error.
I've been shopping.
Here we go then.
You realise you don't exactly look like Magnussen? Which in this case is a considerable advantage.
Sherlock, you complete loon.
What are you doing?! Hang on, was that? Hi, Janine.
Go on, let me in.
I can't.
You know I can't.
Don't be silly.
Don't make me do it out here.
Not in front of everyone.
Do what in front of everyone? You see, as long as there's people, there's always a weak spot.
That was Janine.
Yes, of course it was.
She's Magnussen's PA.
That's the whole point.
Did you just get engaged to break into an office? Yeah.
Stroke of luck meeting her at your wedding.
You can take some of the credit.
Jesus! Sherlock, she loves you.
Yes.
Like I said, human error.
What are you going to do? Well, not actually marry her, obviously.
There's only so far you can go.
So, what will you tell her? Well, I'll tell her that our entire relationship was a ruse to break into her boss's office.
I imagine she'll want to stop seeing me at that point, but you're the expert on women.
So, where did she go? That's a bit rude.
I just proposed to her.
Sherlock.
Did she faint? Do they really do that?! It's a blow to the head.
She's breathing.
Janine? Another in here.
Security.
Does he need help? Ex-con.
White supremacist by the tattoos, so who cares? Stick with Janine.
Janine, focus on my voice.
Can you hear me? Hey, they must still be here.
So is Magnussen.
His seat's still warm.
He should be at dinner, but he's still in the building.
Upstairs.
We should call the police.
During our own burglary? You're really not a natural at this, are you? No, wait.
Sssh.
Perfume and not Janine's.
Claire de la Lune.
Why do I know it? Mary wears it.
No, not Mary.
Somebody else.
Sherlock! What would your husband think? Your lovely husband, upright and honourable, so English.
What would he say to you now? No, no! You're doing this to protect him from the truth? Well, is this the protection he would want? Additionally, if you're going to commit murder, you might consider changing your perfume, Lady Smallwood.
Sorry.
Who? That's not Lady Smallwood, Mr Holmes.
Is John with you? He's, um Is John here? He's downstairs.
So, what do you do now? Kill us both? Mary, whatever he's got on you, let me help.
Oh, Sherlock, if you take one more step, I swear I will kill you.
No, Mrs Watson you won't.
I'm sorry, Sherlock.
I truly am.
Mary? It's not like it is in the movies.
There's not a great big spurt of blood and you go flying backwards.
The impact isn't spread over a wide area.
It's tightly focused so there's little or no energy transfer.
You stay still and the bullet pushes through.
You're almost certainly going to die, so we need to focus.
I said, "Focus!" It's all well and clever having a mind palace, but you've only three seconds of consciousness left to use it.
So, come on.
What's going to kill you? Blood loss.
Exactly.
So, it's all about one thing now - forwards or backwards? We need to decide which way you're going to fall.
One hole or two? Sorry? Is the bullet still inside you? Or is there an exit wound? It'll depend on the gun.
That one, I think.
Or that one.
Oh, for God's sake, Sherlock.
It doesn't matter about the gun.
Don't be stupid.
You always were so stupid.
Such a disappointment.
I'm not stupid.
You're a very stupid little boy.
Mummy and Daddy are very cross because it doesn't matter about the gun.
Why not? You saw the whole room when you entered it.
What was directly behind you when you were murdered? I've not been murdered YET.
Balance of probability, little brother.
If the bullet had passed through you, what would you have heard? The mirror shattering.
You didn't.
Therefore? The bullet's still inside me.
So we need to take him down backwards.
I agree.
Sherlock, you need to fall on your back.
Right now the bullet is the cork in a bottle.
The bullet itself is blocking most of the blood flow.
But any pressure or impact on the entrance wound could dislodge it.
Plus, on your back, gravity's working for us.
Fall now.
What the hell is that?! What's happening?! You're going into shock.
It's the next thing that's going to kill you.
What do I do? Don't go into shock, obviously.
Must be something in this ridiculous memory palace of yours that can calm you down.
Find it.
The East Wind is coming, Sherlock.
It's coming to get you.
Find it.
Hello, Redbeard.
Here, boy.
Come on.
Come to me.
It's OK.
It's all right.
Come on.
It's me.
It's me.
Come on.
Good boy.
Clever boy.
Good boy.
Hello, Redbeard.
They're putting me down too now.
It's no fun, is it? Redbeard.
That was shock.
You're going to feel the pain.
There's a hole ripped through you.
Massive internal bleeding.
You have to control the pain.
Control.
Control.
Control.
You You never felt pain, did you? Why did you never feel pain? You always feel it, Sherlock.
But you don't have to fear it! Pain heartbreak loss death it's all good.
It's all good.
Sherlock! Sherlock.
Can you hear me? What happened? He got shot.
Jesus! Sherlock.
Oh, my! Who shot him?! 'Emergency.
Which service do you require?' It's raining It's pouring Sherlock is boring I'm laughing I'm crying Sherlock is dying.
Sherlock! We're losing you.
Sherlock! Come on, Sherlock.
Just die, why can't you? One little push and off you pop.
You're going to love being dead, Sherlock.
No-one ever bothers you.
Mrs Hudson will cry and Mummy and Daddy will cry and the woman will cry and John will cry buckets and buckets.
It's him that I worry about the most.
That wife! You're letting him down, Sherlock.
John Watson is definitely in danger.
Oh, you're not getting better, are you? Was it something I said, huh? Sherlock! Mary.
Hey.
He's only bloody woken up.
He's pulled through.
Really? Yeah.
Seriously? You Mrs Watson, you're in big trouble.
Really? Why? His first word when he woke up "Mary.
" You don't tell him.
Sherlock? You don't tell John.
Bad girl.
Bad, bad girl.
Look at me and tell me you're not going to tell him.
I'm buying a cottage.
I've made a lot of money out of you, mister.
Nothing hits the spot like revenge with profits.
You didn't give those stories to Magnussen, did you? God, no.
One of his rivals.
He was spitting.
Hmm.
Sherlock Holmes, you are a back-stabbing, heartless, manipulative bastard.
And you, as it turns out, are a grasping, opportunistic, publicity-hungry, tabloid whore.
So, we're good then? Yeah, of course.
Where's the cottage? Sussex Downs.
Nice.
It's gorgeous.
There's beehives, but I'm getting rid of those.
Oh, it hurts, does it? Probably want to restart your morphine.
I might have fiddled with the taps.
How much more revenge are you going to need? Just the occasional top-up.
Dream come true for you, this place.
They actually attach the drugs to you.
Not good for working.
You won't be working for a while, Sherl.
You lied to me.
You lied and lied.
I exploited the fact of our connection.
When? Just once would have been nice.
Oh.
I was waiting till we got married.
That was never going to happen.
Got to go.
I'm not supposed to keep you talking.
And also, I have an interview with The One Show and I haven't made it up yet.
Just one thing you shouldn't have lied to me.
I know what kind of man you are, but we could have been friends.
I'll give your love to John and Mary.
You don't tell him.
You don't tell John.
So Mary Watson who are you? Mary Watson.
I don't know how much sense you'll get out of him.
He's drugged up, so he's pretty much babbling.
Oh, they won't let you use that in here, you know? No, I'm not going to use the phone.
I just want to take a video.
Oh, Jesus! So, where would he go? Oh, Christ knows! Try finding Sherlock in London.
He's got three known bolt-holes.
Parliament Hill, Camden Lock and Dagmar Court.
Five known bolt holes.
There's the blind greenhouse in Kew Gardens and the leaning tomb in Hampstead Cemetery.
Just the spare bedroom.
Well, my bedroom.
We agreed he needs the space.
Behind the clock face of Big Ben.
I think he was probably joking.
No, I don't think so.
Leinster Gardens.
It's his number one bolt hole.
Top, top secret.
He only knows about it cos he stalked him one night.
Followed! Followed, yeah.
He knew who shot him.
The bullet wound was here, so he was facing whoever it was.
So, why not tell us? Because he's tracking them down himself.
Or protecting them.
Protecting the shooter, why? Well, protecting someone then.
But why would he care? He's Sherlock.
Who would he bother protecting? Call me if you hear anything.
Don't hold out on me, John.
Call me, OK? Yeah.
Yeah, right.
Good night then.
Bye then.
John, need a cuppa? Mrs Hudson, why does Sherlock think that I'll be moving back in here? Oh, yes, he's put your chair back again, hasn't he? That's nice.
It looks much better.
John, what's wrong? Tell me.
John? That's your phone, isn't it? It's Sherlock, John.
Sherlock.
John, you have to answer it! Spare any change, love? No.
Oh, come on, love.
Don't be like all the rest.
Rule one of looking for Sherlock Holmes, he finds you.
You're working for Sherlock now? Keeps me off the streets, doesn't it? Well no.
Where are you? 'Can't you see me?' Well, what am I looking for? 'The lie, the lie of Leinster Gardens, hidden in plain sight.
'Hardly anyone notices.
People live here for years and never see it.
'But if you are what I think you are, it will take you less than a minute.
'The houses, Mary.
Look at the houses.
' How did you know I'd come here? 'I knew you'd talk to the people no-one else would bother with.
' Huh, I thought I was being clever.
'You're always clever, Mary, I was relying on that.
'I planted the information for you to find.
' Ohh! '30 seconds.
' But what am I looking at? 'No door knobs, no letterbox.
Painted windows.
'23 and 24 Leinster Gardens.
'The empty houses.
'They were demolished years ago to make way for the London Underground, 'a vent for the old steam trains.
'Only the very front section of the house remains.
' 'It's just a facade.
'Remind you of anyone, Mary? 'A facade? 'Sorry, I never could resist a touch of drama.
'Do come in.
It's a little cramped.
' Do you own this place? 'Hmm, I won it in a card game with the Clarence House Cannibal.
'Nearly cost me my kidneys, but fortunately I had a straight flush.
'Quite a gambler, that woman.
' What do you want, Sherlock? 'Mary Morstan was stillborn in October 1972.
'Her gravestone is in Chiswick cemetery, where five years ago 'you acquired her name and date of birth, and thereafter her identity.
'That's why you don't have friends from before that date.
' Need to work on your half of the church, Mary.
Looking a bit thin.
Oh, orphan's lot.
Friends, that's all I have.
'It's an old enough technique, known to the kinds of people 'who could recognise a skip code on sight' At first I thought it was just a Bible thing, spam, but it's not.
It's a skip code.
'.
.
Have extraordinarily retentive memories.
' How can you not remember which room? You remember everything! I have to delete something! 207.
You were very slow.
'How good a shot are you?' How badly do you want to find out? 'If I die here, my body would be found in a building 'with your face projected on the front of it.
'Even Scotland Yard could get somewhere with that.
'I want to know how good you are.
'Go on, show me.
'The doctor's wife must be a little bit bored by now.
' May I see? Huh, it's a dummy.
Well, I suppose that was a fairly obvious trick.
And yet, over a distance of six feet, you failed to make a kill shot.
Enough to hospitalise me, not enough to kill me.
That wasn't a miss, that was surgery.
I'll take the case.
What case? Yours.
Why didn't you come to me in the first place? Because John can't ever know that I lied to him.
It would break him and I would lose him forever.
And Sherlock, I will never let that happen.
Please, understand, there is nothing in this world I would not do to stop that happening.
Sorry.
Not that obvious a trick.
Now talk and sort it out and do it quickly.
"Hark! The Herald Angels Sing" Oh, dear God, it's only two o'clock.
It's been Christmas Day for at least a week now.
How can it only be two o'clock? I'm in agony.
Mikey, is this your laptop? Upon which depends the security of the free world, yes, and you've got potatoes on it! You shouldn't leave it lying around if it's so important.
Why are we doing this? We never do this.
We are here because Sherlock is home from hospital and we are all very happy.
Am I happy too? I haven't checked.
Behave, Mike! Mycroft is the name you gave me, if you could possibly struggle all the way to the end.
Mrs Holmes.
Oh, thank you, dear.
I'm not absolutely sure why you're here.
I invited him.
I'm his protege, Mrs Holmes.
When he dies, I get all his stuff and his job.
No.
Oh, well, I help out a bit.
Closer.
If he does get murdered or something Probably stop talking now.
OK.
Lovely when you bring your friends round(!) Stop it, you.
Somebody's put a bullet in my boy.
If I ever find out who, I shall turn absolutely monstrous.
This was for Mary.
I'll be back in a minute.
Ah.
Mary.
There you are.
Cup of tea.
If Father starts making little humming noises, just give him a little poke.
That usually does it.
Did you write this? Oh, that silly old thing, you mustn't read that.
Mathematics must seem terribly fatuous now.
No humming, you.
Complete flake, my wife, but happens to be a genius.
She was a mathematician? Gave it all up for children.
I could never bear to argue with her.
I'm something of a moron myself.
But she's unbelievably hot.
Oh my God, you're the sane one, aren't you? Aren't you? Oh.
Sorry, I just, er Oh, you two need a moment? If you don't mind? No, course not.
I'll go and see if I can help with something or another.
Those two.
They all right? Well, you know, they've had their ups and downs.
Baker Street, now.
John, Mary Oh, Sherlock, oh, good gracious, you look terrible! Get me some morphine from your kitchen, I've run out.
I don't have any morphine.
Then what exactly is the point of you?! What is going on? Bloody good question.
The Watsons are about to have a domestic and fairly quickly I hope, because we've got work to do.
No, I have a better question - is everyone I have ever met a psychopath? Yes.
Good that we've settled that.
Now we SHUT UP! And stay shut up, because this is not funny.
Not this time.
I didn't say it was funny.
You.
What have I ever done? Hmm? My whole life, to deserve you? Everything.
Sherlock, I've told you, shut up.
No, I mean it - seriously, everything.
Everything you've ever done, is what you did.
Sherlock, one more word and you will not need morphine.
You were a doctor who went to war.
You're a man who couldn't stay in the suburbs for more than a month without storming a crack den, beating up a junkie.
Your best friend is a sociopath, who solves crimes as an alternative to getting high.
That's me, by the way, hello.
Even the landlady used to run a drug cartel.
It was my husband's cartel.
I was just typing.
And exotic dancing.
Sherlock Holmes, if you've been YouTubing John, you are addicted to a certain lifestyle.
You are abnormally attracted to dangerous situations and people, so is it truly such a surprise that the woman you fall in love with conforms to that pattern? But she wasn't supposed to be like that! Why is SHE like that? Because you chose her.
Why is everything always MY FAULT?! Oh, neighbours! John, listen.
Be calm and answer me.
What is she? My lying wife? No, what is she? And the woman who is carrying my child, who has lied to me since the day I met her.
No.
Not in this flat, not in this room.
Right here, right now, what is she? OK.
Your way.
Always your way.
Sit.
Why? Because that's where they sit.
The people who come in here with their stories.
They're the clients, that's all you are now, Mary.
You're a client.
This is where you sit and talk and this is where we sit and listen.
Then we decide if we want you or not.
So, are you OK? Oh, are we doing conversation today? It really is Christmas(!) Now? Seriously, months of silence and we're going to do this now? A.
G.
R.
A.
, what's that? Er my initials.
Everything about who I was is on there.
If you love me, don't read it in front of me.
Why? Because you won't love me when you've finished and I don't want to see that happen.
How much do you know already? By your skill set, you are, or were, an intelligence agent.
Your accent is currently English, but I suspect you are not.
You're on the run from something.
You've used your skills to disappear.
Magnussen knows your secret, which is why you were going to kill him.
And I assume you befriended Janine in order to get close to him.
Oh, you can talk! Oh, look at you two, you should have got married.
The stuff Magnussen has on me, I would go to prison for the rest of my life.
So you were going to kill him? People like Magnussen should be killed, that's why there are people like me.
Perfect! So that's what you were, an assassin? How could I not see that? You did see that.
And you married me.
Because he's right.
It's what you like.
So, Mary, any documents that Magnussen has concerning yourself, you want extracted and returned.
Why would you help me? Because you saved my life.
Sorry-sorry, what? When I happened on you and Magnussen you had a problem.
More specifically, you had a witness.
What do you do now? Kill both of us? 'The solution, of course, was simple.
Kill us both and leave.
' However, sentiment got the better of you.
'One precisely calculated shot to incapacitate me, 'in the hope that it would buy you more time to negotiate my silence.
' Of course, you couldn't shoot Magnussen.
On the night both of us broke into the building, your own husband would become a suspect.
So 'You calculated that Magnussen would use the fact of your involvement' rather than sharing the information with the police, as is his MO.
And then you left the way you came.
Have I missed anything? How did she save your life? She phoned the ambulance.
I phoned the ambulance.
She phoned first.
'Emergency, which service do you require?' You didn't find me for another five minutes.
Left to you, I would have died.
The average arrival time for a London ambulance is Did somebody call an ambulance? Eight minutes.
Did you bring any morphine? I asked on the phone.
We were told there was a shooting.
There was, last week.
But I believe I'm bleeding internally, my pulse is very erratic, you may need to restart my heart on the way Jesus, Sherlock.
Come on, Sherlock.
Argh! John, John, Magnussen is all that matters now.
You can trust Mary - she saved my life.
She shot you.
Mixed messages, I grant you that Argh! Sherlock! Sherlock! Take him.
Got him? Yeah.
So, have you read it? Would you come here a moment? No, tell me, have you? Just Come here.
No, I'm fine.
I've thought long and hard about what I want to say to you.
These are prepared words, Mary.
I've chosen these words with care.
OK.
The problems of your past are your business.
The problems of your future are my privilege.
It's all I have to say, it's all I need to know.
No, I didn't read it.
You don't even know my name.
Is "Mary Watson" good enough for you? Yes.
Oh my God, yes.
Then it's good enough for me, too.
All this does not mean that I'm not still basically pissed off with you.
Hmm, I know, I know.
I am very pissed off, and it will come out now and then.
I know, I know, I know.
You can mow the sodding lawn from now on.
I do mow the lawn.
I do it loads.
You really don't.
I choose the baby's name.
Not a chance.
OK.
I'm glad you've given up on the Magnussen business.
Are you? I'm still curious, though.
He's hardly your usual kind of puzzle.
Why do you hate him? Because he attacks people who are different and preys on their secrets.
Why don't you? He never causes too much damage to anyone important.
He's far too intelligent for that.
He's a businessman, that's all.
And occasionally useful to us.
A necessary evil, not a dragon for you to slay.
A dragon-slayer.
Is that what you think of me? No.
It's what you think of yourself.
Are you two smoking?! No.
It was Mycroft.
I have, by the way, a job offer I should like you to decline.
I decline your kind offer.
I shall pass on your regrets.
What was it? MI6.
They want to place you back into Eastern Europe.
An undercover assignment that would prove fatal to you in, I think, about six months.
Then why don't you want me to take it? It's tempting, but on balance, you have more utility closer to home.
Utility! How do I have utility? Here be dragons.
This isn't agreeing with me.
I'm going in.
You need low tar.
You still smoke like a beginner.
Also your loss would break my heart.
What the hell am I supposed to say to that?! Merry Christmas? You hate Christmas.
Yes.
Perhaps there was something in the punch.
Clearly.
Go and have some more.
So you realise that Sherlock got us out here to see his mum and dad for a reason? His lovely mum and dad, a fine example of married life, I get that.
That is the thing with Sherlock, it's always the unexpected.
Oi.
Oi? Mary? Jesus Christ! Mary? Sit down.
Mary, can you hear me? Don't drink Mary's tea.
Or the punch.
Sherlock Did you just drug my pregnant wife?! Don't worry, Wiggins is an excellent chemist.
I calculated your wife's dose myself.
Won't affect the little one.
I'll keep an eye on her.
He'll monitor their recovery.
It's more or less his day job.
What the hell have you done?! A deal with the devil.
Shouldn't you be in hospital? I am in hospital.
This is the canteen.
Is it? In my opinion, yes.
Have a seat.
Thank you.
I've been thinking about you.
I've been thinking about you.
Really? I want to see Appledore.
Where you keep all the secrets, all the files, everything you've got on everyone.
I want you to invite me.
What makes you think I'd be so careless? Oh, I think you're a lot more careless than you let on.
Am I? It's the dead-eyed stare that gives it away.
Except it's not dead-eyed, is it? You're reading.
Portable Appledore.
How does it work? Built-in flash drive? 4G wireless? They're just ordinary spectacles.
Yes, they are.
You underestimate me, Mr Holmes.
Impress me, then.
Show me Appledore.
Everything is available for a price.
Are you making me an offer? A Christmas present.
And what are you giving me for Christmas, Mr Holmes? My brother.
Oh, Jesus! Sherlock, please tell me you haven't just gone out of your mind.
I'd rather keep you guessing.
Ah, there's our lift.
Coming? Where? You want your wife to be safe? Of course I do.
Good, because this is going to be incredibly dangerous.
One false move and we'll have betrayed the security of the United Kingdom and be in prison for high treason.
Magnussen is the most dangerous man we've ever encountered and the odds are comprehensively stacked against us.
But it's Christmas! I feel the same.
Oh, you mean it's actually Christmas.
Did you bring your gun, as I suggested? Why would I bring my gun to your parents' house for Christmas dinner?! Is it in your coat? Yes.
Off we go, then.
Where are we going? Appledore.
I would offer you a drink, but it's very rare and expensive.
Oh, it WAS you.
Yes, of course.
Very hard to find a pressure point on you, Mr Holmes.
The drugs thing I never believed for a moment.
Anyway, you wouldn't care if it was exposed, would you? But look how you care about John Watson.
Your damsel in distress.
You put me in a fire, for leverage?! Oh, I would never let you burn, Dr Watson.
I had people standing by.
I'm not a murderer.
Unlike your wife.
Let me explain how leverage works, Dr Watson.
For those who understand these things, Mycroft Holmes is the most powerful man in the country.
Well, apart from me.
Mycroft's pressure point is his junkie detective brother, Sherlock.
Sherlock's pressure point is his best friend, John Watson.
John Watson's pressure point is his wife.
I own John Watson's wife, I own Mycroft.
He's what I'm getting for Christmas.
It's an exchange, not a gift.
Forgive me, but I already seem to have it.
It's password protected.
In return for the password, you will give me any material in your possession pertaining to the woman I know as Mary Watson.
Oh, she's bad, that one.
So many dead people.
You should see what I've seen.
I don't need to see it.
You might enjoy it, though.
I enjoy it.
Then why don't you show us? Show you Appledore? The secret vaults.
Is that what you want? I want everything you've got on Mary.
You know, I honestly expected something good.
Oh, I think you'll find the contents of that laptop Include a GPS locator.
By now your brother will have noticed the theft and the security services will be converging on this house.
Having arrived, they'll find top-secret information in my hands and they have every justification to search my vaults.
They will discover further information of this kind and I will be imprisoned.
You would be exonerated and restored to your smelly little apartment to solve crimes with Mr and Mrs Psychopath.
Mycroft has been looking for this opportunity for a long time.
He'll be a very, very proud big brother.
The fact that you know it's going to happen isn't going to stop it.
Then why am I smiling? Ask me.
Why are you smiling? Because Sherlock Holmes has made one enormous mistake, which will destroy the lives of everyone he loves.
And everything he holds dear.
Let me show you the Appledore vaults.
The entrance to my vaults.
This is where I keep you all.
OK, so where are the vaults, then? Vaults? What vaults? There are no vaults beneath this building.
They're all in here.
The Appledore vaults are my mind palace.
You know about mind palaces, don't you, Sherlock? How to store information so you never forget it, by picturing it.
I just sit here, I close my eyes and down I go to my vaults.
I can go anywhere inside my vaults.
My memories.
I'll look at the files on Mrs Watson.
Hmm.
Oh, this is one of my favourites.
Oh, it's so exciting.
All those wet jobs for the CIA.
Ooh, she's gone a bit freelance now, bad girl.
Oh, she's so wicked.
I can really see why you like her.
You see? So there are no documents, you don't actually have anything here? Oh, sometimes I send out for something, if I really need it, but mostly I just remember it all.
I don't understand.
You should have that on a T-shirt.
You just remember it all? It's all about knowledge, everything is.
Knowing is owning.
But if you just know it, then you don't have proof.
Proof? What would I need proof for? I'm in news, you moron.
I don't have to prove it, I just have to print it.
Speaking of news You'll both be heavily featured tomorrow.
Trying to sell state secrets to me.
Tut tut.
Let's go outside.
They'll be here shortly.
Can't wait to see you arrested.
Sherlock, do we have a plan? Sherlock? They're taking their time, aren't they? I still don't understand.
And there's the back of the T-shirt.
You just know things - how does that work? I just love your little soldier face.
I'd like to punch it.
Bring it over here a minute.
Come on.
For Mary.
Bring me your face.
Lean forward a bit and stick your face out.
Please.
Now, can I flick it? Look at me.
Can I flick your face? I just love doing this.
I could do it all day.
Well, it works like this, John.
I know who Mary hurt and killed.
I know where to find people who hate her.
I know where they live, I know their phone numbers.
All in my mind palace, all of it.
I could phone them right now and tear your whole life down and I will, unless you let me flick your face.
This is what I do to people.
This is what I do to whole countries.
Just because I know.
Can I do your eye now? See if you can keep it open, hmm? Come on, for Mary.
Keep it open.
Sherlock? Let him.
I'm sorry, just let him.
Hmm? Come on, eye open.
It's difficult, isn't it? Janine managed to once.
She makes the funniest noises.
Sherlock Holmes and John Watson, stand away from that man.
Here we go, Mr Holmes.
To clarify, Appledore's vaults only exist in your mind, nowhere else, just there? They're not real, they never have been.
Sherlock Holmes and John Watson, step away! It's fine, they're harmless.
'Target is not armed, I repeat target is not armed.
' Sherlock, what do we do? Nothing.
There is nothing to be done.
Oh, I'm not a villain, I have no evil plan.
I'm a businessman, acquiring assets.
You happen to be one of them.
Sorry, no chance for you to be a hero this time, Mr Holmes.
Sherlock Holmes and John Watson, stand away from that man.
Do it now! Oh, do your research.
I'm not a hero, I'm a high-functioning sociopath.
Merry Christmas! 'Man down, man down.
' Get away from me, John! Stay well back! Christ, Sherlock! Don't fire! Do not fire on Sherlock Holmes! Do not fire! Oh Christ, Sherlock! Give my love to Mary.
Tell her she's safe now.
Oh, Sherlock.
What have you done? As my colleague is fond of remarking, this country sometimes needs a blunt instrument.
Equally, it sometimes needs a dagger, a scalpel wielded with precision and without remorse.
There will always come a time when we need Sherlock Holmes.
If this is some expression of familial sentiment Don't be absurd.
I am not given to outbursts of brotherly compassion.
You know what happened to the other one.
In any event, there is no prison in which we could incarcerate Sherlock without causing a riot on a daily basis.
The alternative, however, would require your approval.
Hardly merciful, Mr Holmes.
Regrettably, Lady Smallwood, my brother is a murderer.
You will look after him for me, won't you? Hmm.
Don't worry.
I'll keep him in trouble.
That's my girl.
Since this is likely to be the last conversation I'll have with John Watson, would you mind if we took a moment? So here we are.
William Sherlock Scott Holmes.
Sorry? That's the whole of it.
If you're looking for baby names.
No, we've had a scan, we're pretty sure it's a girl.
Oh.
OK.
Yeah.
You know, actually, I can't think of a single thing to say.
No, neither can I.
The game is over.
The game is never over, John.
But there may be some new players now.
That's OK, the East Wind takes us all in the end.
What's that? It's a story my brother told me when we were kids.
The East Wind is a terrifying force that lays waste to all in its path.
It seeks out the unworthy and plucks them from the earth.
That was generally me.
Nice(!) He's a rubbish big brother.
So what about you, then? Where are you actually going now? Oh, some undercover work in Eastern Europe.
For how long? Six months, my brother estimates.
He's never wrong.
And then what? Who knows? John, there's something I should say, I've meant to say always and I never have.
Since it's unlikely we'll ever meet again, I might as well say it now.
Sherlock is actually a girl's name.
It's not.
It was worth a try.
We're not naming our daughter after you.
Oh, I think it could work.
To the very best of times, John.
'Smith brings it inside.
This looks good.
'Cassandra comes in for a shot.
Ooh, he missed it!' Oi, there's something wrong with the telly.
There's something wrong with the telly, mate.
Who's that? Did you miss me? Did you miss me? Did you miss me? Did you miss me? Did you miss me? How is this possible? We don't know, but it's on every screen in the country.
Every screen simultaneously.
Has the Prime Minister been told? And Mycroft? But that's not possible.
That is simply not possible.
What's happened? Sir? It's your brother.
Mycroft? 'Hello, little brother.
How's the exile going?' I've only been gone four minutes.
Well, I certainly hope you've learnt your lesson.
'As it turns out, you're needed.
' Oh, for God's sake, make up your mind! Who needs me this time? 'Did you miss me? Did you miss me? Did you miss me? Did you miss me? 'Did you miss me? Did you miss me? Did you miss me? Did you miss me?' England.
But he's dead.
I mean, you told me he was dead, Moriarty? Absolutely.
Blew his own brains out.
So how can he be back? Well if he is, he'd better wrap up warm.
There's an East Wind coming.
Miss me?
The name's Sherlock Holmes and the address is 221B Baker Street.
- Afternoon.
- Yeah.
He's always like that.
Bad day was it? Since yesterday you've moved in with him and now you're solving crimes together.
Mwah! Look at you, all happy, it's not decent.
Who cares about decent? The game, Mrs.
Hudson, is on! Don't make people into heroes, John.
Heroes don't exist and, if they did, I wouldn't be one of them.
I will burn the heart out of you.
Right, this should do it.
- Are you wearing any pants? - No.
OK.
This is how I want you to remember me, the woman who beat you.
But there never was any monster.
Sherlock? Here we are, at last.
Argh! - Goodbye, John.
- Sherlock! 'Those things will kill you.
' Oh, you bastard! The thrill of the chase, the blood pumping through your veins, just the two of us against the rest of the world.
Wait! We're going to need to coordinate.
I asked you for one more miracle.
- I asked you to stop being dead.
- I heard you.
Shut up! You are not a puzzle solver, you never have been.
You're a drama queen! Now there is a man in there about to die.
The game is on, solve it! He is the Napoleon of blackmail.
No chance for you to be a hero this time, Mr.
Holmes.
I'm a high-functioning sociopath! There is no prison in which we could incarcerate Sherlock without causing a riot on a daily basis.
The alternative, however, would require your approval.
To the very best of times, John.
Did you miss me? Did you miss me? How is this possible? - How is the exile going? - I've only been gone four minutes.
Well, I certainly hope you've learnt your lesson.
Who needs me this time? Miss me? England.
"The Second Afghan War brought honours and promotion to many.
"But, for me, it meant nothing but misfortune and disaster.
" All right, Captain.
"I returned to England with my health irretrievably ruined "and my future bleak.
"Under such circumstances, I naturally gravitated to London.
"That great cesspool into which all the loungers" - Watson! - ".
.
And idlers of the empire are drained.
" Watson! Stamford.
Remember? We were at Barts together.
Yes, of course.
Stamford.
Good Lord! Where have you been? You're as thin as a rake! I made it home.
Many weren't so lucky.
- So what now? - I need a place to live.
Somewhere decent at an affordable price.
It's not easy.
You know, you're the second person to say that to me today.
Hmm? Who was the first? Good Lord.
It's an experiment, apparently.
Beating corpses to establish how long after death bruising is still possible.
- Is there a medical point to that? - Not sure.
Neither am I.
So, where's this friend of yours, then? Excuse me.
I do hope we're not interrupting.
You've been in Afghanistan, I perceive.
Dr.
Watson, Mr.
Sherlock Excellent reflexes, you'll do.
I'm sorry? I have my eye on a suite of rooms near Regent's Park.
Between us we could afford them.
Rooms? Who said anything about rooms? I did, I mentioned it this morning, I was in need of a fellow lodger.
Now he appears after lunch in the company of a man of military aspect with a tan and a recent injury, both suggestive of the campaign in Afghanistan and an enforced departure from it.
The conclusion seemed inescapable.
We'll finalise the details tomorrow evening.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a hanging in Wandsworth and I'd hate them to start without me.
- A hanging? - I take a professional interest.
I also play the violin and smoke a pipe.
I presume that's not a problem.
Er, no, well And you're clearly acclimatized to never getting to the end of a sentence.
We'll get along splendidly.
Tomorrow evening, seven o'clock, then.
Oh, and the name is Sherlock Holmes and the address is 221B, Baker Street.
Yes he's always been like that.
Papers! Papers! Papers! Papers! Here, how's The Blue Carbuncle doing? Very popular, Dr.
Watson.
Is there going to be a proper murder next month? I'll have a word with the criminal classes.
If you wouldn't mind.
Is that him? Is he in there? Ow! No.
No, no, not at all.
Er, good day to you.
Let on, walk.
Merry Christmas, Mr.
Holmes! Mr.
Holmes! I do wish you'd let me know when you're planning to come home! I hardly knew myself, Mrs.
Hudson.
That's the trouble with dismembered country squires.
They're notoriously difficult to schedule.
- What's in there? - Never mind.
Thank you.
Did you catch the murderer, Mr.
Holmes? Caught the murderer, still looking for the legs.
I think we'll call it a draw.
And I noticed you've published another of your stories, Dr.
Watson.
- Yes, did you enjoy it? - No.
Oh? - I never enjoy them.
- Why not? Well, I never say anything, do I? According to you, I just show people up the stairs and serve you breakfasts.
Well, within the narrative, that is, broadly speaking, your function.
My what?! Don't feel singled out, Mrs.
Hudson, I'm hardly in the dog one.
"The dog one?" I'm your landlady, not a plot device.
Do you mean The Hound Of The Baskervilles? And you make the rooms so drab and dingy.
Oh, blame it on the illustrator, he's out of control! I've had to grow this moustache just so people will recognise me.
"Over the many years it has been my privilege to record "the exploits of my remarkable friend, Mr.
Sherlock Holmes, "it has sometimes been difficult to choose which of his many "cases to set before my readers.
"Some are still too sensitive to recount, "whilst others are too recent in the minds of the public.
"But in all our many adventures together, no case pushed my friend "to such mental and physical extremes "as that of The Abominable Bride!" Good Lord! Mrs.
Hudson, there is a woman in my sitting room! Is it intentional? She's a client.
Said you were out, insisted on waiting.
Would you, er, care to sit down? Didn't you ask her what she wanted? You ask her! Why didn't YOU ask her? How could I, what with me not talking and everything?! Oh, for God's sake, give her some lines, she's perfectly capable of starving us! Good afternoon.
I am Sherlock Holmes, this is my friend and colleague, Dr.
Watson.
You may speak freely in front of him, as he rarely understands a word.
Holmes! However, before you do, allow me to make some trifling observations.
You have an impish sense of humour, which currently you are deploying to ease a degree of personal anguish.
You have recently married a man of a seemingly kindly disposition, who has now abandoned you for an unsavoury companion of dubious morals.
You have come to this agency as a last resort, in the hope that reconciliation may still be possible.
Good Lord, Holmes! All of this is, of course, perfectly evident from your perfume.
Her perfume? Yes, her perfume, which brings insight to me and disaster to you.
How so? Because I recognised it and you did not.
- Mary! - John.
Why, in God's name, are you pretending to be a client? Because I could think of no other way to see my husband, husband.
It was an affair of international intrigue.
- It was a murdered country squire.
- Nevertheless, matters were pressing.
I don't mind you going, my darling, I mind you leaving me behind.
But what could you do?! Well, what do you do, except wander around taking notes, looking surprised?! Enough! The stage is set, the curtain rises.
We are ready to begin.
Begin what? Sometimes to solve a case, one must first solve another.
- Oh, you have a case, then, a new one? - An old one, very old.
I shall have to go deep.
Deep? Into what? Myself.
Lestrade! Do stop loitering by the door and come in.
- How did you know it was me? - The regulation tread is unmistakable.
Lighter than Jones, heavier than Gregson.
I, I just came up Mrs.
Hudson didn't seem to be talking.
I fear she has branched into literary criticism by means of satire.
It is a distressing trend in the modern landlady.
What brings you here in your off-duty hours? How do you know I'm off duty? Well, since your arrival, you've addressed over 40% of your remarks to my decanter.
Watson, give the Inspector what he so clearly wants.
So Lestrade, what can we do for you? Oh, I'm not here on business, I just thought I'd drop by.
A social call? Yeah, of course, just to wish you the compliments of the season.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
Thank God that's over.
Now, Inspector, what strange happening compels you to my door, but embarrasses you to relate? Who said anything happened? You did.
By every means short of actual speech.
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, Holmes, you have misdiagnosed.
Then, correct me, Doctor.
He didn't WANT a drink, he needed one.
He's not embarrassed, he's afraid.
My Boswell is learning.
They do grow up so fast.
Watson, restore the courage of Scotland Yard.
Inspector, do sit down.
I'm, I'm not afraid, exactly.
Fear is wisdom in the face of danger, it is nothing to be ashamed of.
Thank you.
From the beginning, then.
You! No, please! You?! A moment.
When was this? Yesterday morning.
The bride's face, how was it described? "White as death, mouth like a crimson wound.
" Poetry or truth? Many would say they're the same thing.
Yes, idiots.
Poetry or truth? I saw her face myself.
Afterwards.
After what? You? Or me? Oh, really, Lestrade, a woman blows her own brains out in public and you need help identifying the guilty party? I feel Scotland Yard has reached a new low.
That's not why I'm here.
- I surmised.
- What was her name, the bride? Emelia Ricoletti.
Yesterday was her wedding anniversary.
The police, of course, were called.
And her body taken to the morgue.
Standard procedure.
Why are you telling us what may be presumed? Because of what happened next.
Limehouse.
Just a few hours later.
Thomas Ricoletti.
Emelia Ricoletti's husband.
Presumably on his way to the morgue to identify her remains? As it turned out, he was saved the trip.
Do not forget me Do not forget me Remember the maid Who are you? The maid of the mill Why are you doing this? Just tell me who you are! You recognise our song, my dear? I sang it at our wedding.
Emelia? You, you're dead, you can't be here, you died! Am I not beautiful, Thomas? As beautiful as the day you married me? What the hell is all this about?! What does it look like, my handsome friend? It's a shotgun wedding.
Till death us do part.
Twice in this case.
Extraordinary.
Impossible.
Superb.
Suicide as street theatre, murder by corpse.
Lestrade, you're spoiling us.
Watson, your hat and coat.
- Where are we going? - To the morgue.
There's not a moment to lose, which one can so rarely say of a morgue.
And am I just to sit here? Not at all, my dear.
We'll be hungry later.
Holmes, just one thing, tweeds in a morgue? Needs must when the devil drives, Watson.
Ma'am.
- I'm part of a campaign, you know.
- Oh, campaign? - Votes for women.
- And are you for or against? Get out.
Ooh-ooh! Oh, have they gone off again, have they? I don't know, what a life those gentlemen lead.
Huh, yes.
Those gentlemen! Oh, never you mind.
Oh, almost forgot, that came for you.
Oh.
Mrs.
Hudson, tell my husband I'll be home late, I have some urgent business.
Is everything all right? Oh, you know, just a, er, friend in need.
Oh, dear.
What friend? England.
Well, that's not very specific.
Who's on mortuary duty? - You know who.
- Always him.
Please tell me which idiot did this! It's for everyone's safety.
This woman is dead, half her head is missing.
She's not a threat to anyone.
Tell that to her husband, he's under a sheet over there.
Whatever happened in Limehouse last night, I think we can safely assume it wasn't the work of a dead woman.
Stranger things have happened.
Such as? Well Strange things.
You're speaking like a child.
This is clearly man's work.
Where is he? Holmes.
Hooper.
You, back to work! So, come to astonish us with your magic tricks, I suppose? Is there anything to which you would like to draw my attention? Nothing at all, Mr.
Holmes.
You may leave any time you like.
Dr.
Hooper, I asked Mr.
Holmes to come here.
Cooperate.
That's an order.
There are two "features of interest", as you are always saying in Dr.
Watson's stories.
I never say that.
You do, actually, quite a lot.
First of all, this is definitely Emelia Ricoletti.
She has been categorically identified.
Beyond a doubt, it is her.
Then who was that in Limehouse last night? That was also Emelia Ricoletti.
It can't have been.
She was dead, she was here.
She was positively identified by her own husband, seconds before he died.
He had no reason to lie, could hardly have been mistaken.
The cabbie knew her, too, there's no question it's her.
But she can't have been in two places at the same time, can she? No, Watson, one place is strictly the limit for the recently deceased.
Holmes! - Could it have been twins? - No.
Why not? Because it's never twins.
Emelia was not a twin, nor did she have any sisters.
She had one older brother who died four years ago.
Hmm, maybe it was a secret twin.
A what?! A secret twin.
Hmm? You know? A twin that nobody knows about.
This whole thing could have been planned.
Since the moment of conception.
How breathtakingly prescient of her.
- It is never twins, Watson! - Then what's your theory? More to the point, what's your problem? - I, I don't understand - Why were you so frightened? Nothing so far has justified your assault on my decanter, and why have you allowed a dead woman to be placed under arrest? Ah, that would be the other feature of interest.
A smear of blood on her finger.
That could have happened any number of ways.
Indeed.
There's one other thing.
It wasn't there earlier.
Neither was that.
You! You? You?! Holmes? Gun in the mouth, a bullet through the brain Back of the head blown clean off.
How could he survive? "She", you mean.
I'm sorry? Not "he", "she".
Yes, yes of course.
Well, thank you all for a fascinating case.
I'll send you a telegram when I've solved it.
Watson.
The gunshot wound was obviously the cause of death, but there are clear indicators of consumption.
It might be worth a postmortem.
We need all the information we can get.
Oh, isn't he observant, now that Daddy's gone! I AM observant in some ways, just as Holmes is quite blind in others.
Really? Yes, really.
Amazing what one has to do to get ahead in a man's world.
What's he saying that for? Get back to work! Well, Holmes? Surely you must have some theory? Not yet.
These are deep waters, Watson, deep waters.
And I shall have to go deeper still.
"It was not for several months that we were to pick up "the threads of this strange case again.
"And then under very unexpected circumstances.
" Five of them now, all the same, every one of them.
Hush, please, this is a matter of supreme importance.
What is? The obliquity of the ecliptic.
I have to understand it.
What is it? I don't know, I'm still trying to understand it.
I thought you understood everything.
Of course not, that would be an appalling waste of brain space.
I specialise.
And what's so important about this? What's so important about five boring murders? They're not boring.
Five men dead, murdered in their own homes, rice on the floor like at a wedding, and the word "You" written in blood on the wall! It's, it's her, it's the Bride.
Somehow she's risen again.
- Solved it.
- You can't have solved it! Of course I've solved it, it's perfectly simple.
The incident of the mysterious Mrs.
Ricoletti, the killer from beyond the grave, has been widely reported in the popular press.
Now people are disguising their own dull little murders as the work of a ghost, to confuse the impossibly imbecilic Scotland Yard.
There you are, solved.
Pay Mrs.
Hudson a visit on your way out, she likes to feel involved.
You sure? Certainly.
Go away.
Watson! I'm ready.
Your hat and boots, we have an important appointment.
Didn't Dr.
Watson move out a few months ago? He did, didn't he? Who have I been talking to all this time? Well, speaking on behalf of the impossibly imbecilic Scotland Yard, that chair is definitely empty.
It is, isn't it? Works surprisingly well, though.
I actually thought he was improving.
Ah.
Where have you been? Sorry, sir, I'm rather behind my time this morning.
Are you incapable of boiling an egg?! The fires are rarely lit, there is dust everywhere and you almost destroyed my boots scraping the mud off them.
If it wasn't my wife's business to deal with the staff, I would talk to you myself.
Where is my wife? Begging your pardon, sir, but the mistress has gone out.
- Out? At this hour of the morning? - Yes, sir.
Did you not know that, sir? Where did she go? She's always out these days.
Not unlike yourself sir.
I'm sorry? Just observing, sir.
Well, that's quite enough, nobody asked you to be observant.
Sorry, sir, I just meant you're hardly ever home together any more, sir.
You are dangerously close to impertinence.
I shall have a word with my wife to have a word with you.
Very good, sir.
And when will you be seeing her? Now, listen Oh, I nearly forgot, sir.
A telegram came for you.
You forgot?! - No, I nearly forgot.
- What have you been doing all morning? Reading your new one in The Strand, sir.
Did you enjoy it? Why do you never mention me, sir? Go away.
- The what of the what? - The obliquity of the ecliptic.
"Come at once," you said.
I assumed it was important.
It is.
It's the inclination of the earth's equator to the path of the sun on the celestial plane.
You been swotting up? - Why would I do that? - To sound clever.
I am clever.
Oh, oh, I see.
You see what? I deduce we're on our way to see someone cleverer than you.
Shut up.
Sh - Sorry, what? - Oh.
To anyone who wishes to study mankind, this is the spot.
Handy really, as your ever-expanding backside is permanently glued to it.
- Good morning, brother mine.
- Sherlock.
Dr.
Watson.
You look well, sir.
Really? I rather thought I looked enormous.
Well, now you mention it, this level of consumption is incredibly injurious to your health.
Your heart - No need to worry on that score, Watson.
- No? There's only a large cavity where that organ should reside.
- It's a family trait.
- Oh, I wasn't being critical.
If you continue like this, sir, I give you five years at the most.
Five? We thought three, did we not, Sherlock? I'm still inclined to four.
As ever, you see but you do not observe.
Note the discolouration in the whites of my eyes, the visible rings of fat around the corneas.
Yes, you're right.
I'm changing my bet to three years, four months and 11 days.
A bet?! I understand your disapproval, Watson, but if he's feeling competitive, it's perfectly within his power to die early.
- That's a risk you'll have to take.
- You're gambling with your own life? Why not? It's so much more exciting than gambling with others'.
Three years flat, if you eat that plum pudding! Done.
I expected to see you a few days ago about the Manor House case.
I thought you might be a little out of your depth there.
No.
I solved it.
- It was Adams, of course.
- Yes, it was Adams.
Murderous jealousy.
He'd written a paper for the Royal Astronomical Society on the obliquity of the ecliptic, and then read another that seemed to surpass it.
- I know, I read it.
- Did you understand it? Yes, of course I understood it, it was perfectly simple.
No, did you understand the murderous jealousy? It is no easy thing for a great mind to contemplate a still greater one.
Did you summon me here just to humiliate me? Yes.
Of course not, but it is by far the greater pleasure.
Then would you mind explaining exactly why you did summon.
.
? Our way of life is under threat from an invisible enemy.
One that hovers at our elbow on a daily basis.
These enemies are everywhere undetected and unstoppable.
Socialists? Not socialists, Doctor, no.
Anarchists? No.
The French? The suffragists? Is there any large body of people you're not concerned about? Dr.
Watson is endlessly vigilant.
Elaborate No.
Investigate.
This is a conjecture of mine, I need you to confirm it.
I'm sending you a case.
The Scots? The Scots?! Are you aware of recent theories concerning what is known as paranoia? Oh, sounds Serbian.
A woman will call on you, Lady Carmichael.
I want you to take her case.
But these enemies, how are we to defeat them if you won't tell us about them? We don't defeat them.
We most certainly lose to them.
Why? Because they are right.
And we are wrong.
Lady Carmichael's case, what is it? Rest assured, it has features of interest.
I never really say that.
You really do.
And you've solved it already, I assume? Only in my head.
I need you for the, er, legwork.
Why not just tell us your solution? And where would be the sport in that? Will you do it, Sherlock? I can promise you a superior distraction.
On one condition.
Have another plum pudding.
There's one on the way.
Two years, 11 months and four days.
Ha, it's getting exciting now! Ticktock, ticktock, ticktock.
Thank you, Wilder.
Also, a Mr.
Melas to see you, Mr.
Holmes.
Ah.
Give me five minutes, I have a wager to win.
Better make that 15.
Ticktock.
Mr.
Holmes, I have come here for advice.
- That is easily got.
- And help.
Not always so easy.
Something has happened, Mr.
Holmes, something unusual and terrifying.
Then you are in luck.
Luck?! Those are my specialisms.
Hmm, this is really very promising.
Holmes Please do tell us what has so distressed you.
I, I thought long and hard as to what to do, but then it occurred to me that my husband was an acquaintance of your brother and that perhaps through him The fact is, I'm not sure this comes within your purview, Mr.
Holmes.
No? Lord help me, I think it may be a matter for a priest.
And what does your morning threaten, my dear? A vigorous round of embroidering? An exhausting appointment at the milliners? I hope you are teasing, Eustace.
What is it? Eustace? Daniel, Sophie, go out and play.
But, Mama Look, do as I tell you, quickly now.
Well, Eustace, what does this mean? Death.
What? It means death.
Er, nothing, it's, er, it's nothing.
I was mistaken.
My dear, you've gone quite pale.
It's nothing! - Eustace - 'Did you keep the envelope?' My husband destroyed it, but it was blank.
No name or address of any kind.
Tell me, has Sir Eustace spent time in America? - No.
- Not even before your marriage? - Well, not to my knowledge.
- Hmm.
Pray, continue with your fascinating narrative.
Well, that incident took place last Monday morning.
It was two days later on the Wednesday that my husband first saw her.
Who? Eustace? She's come for me, Louisa! Oh, God, help me, my sins have found me out! Who's come for you? Eustace, you're frightening me.
Well, look, look! Don't you see her? No, I see no-one.
Gone.
You keep so many secrets from me, is this another? Who have you seen? It was her! It was the Bride! And you saw nothing? Nothing.
- Did your husband describe? - Nothing, until this morning.
Eustace?! Eustace?! Eustace? Eustace?! Argh! Blast! Eustace?! Where are you? It's me! Do not forget me Do not forget me Remember the maid The maid of the mill Who are you? I demand you speak, who are you?! Eustace, speak to me.
In the name of God! She's She is Emelia Ricoletti.
No, not you.
No Please! This night, Eustace Carmichael, you will die! - Holmes? - Hush, Watson.
But Emelia Ricoletti, the Bride.
- Well, you know the name? - You must forgive Watson, he has an enthusiasm for stating the obvious, which borders on mania.
May I ask, how is your husband this morning? He refuses to speak about the matter.
Obviously, I have urged him to leave the house.
No, no, he must stay exactly where he is.
Well, you don't think he's in danger? Oh, no, somebody definitely wants to kill him, but that's good for us.
You can't set a trap without bait.
My husband is not bait, Mr.
Holmes.
No, but he could be if we play our cards right.
Now, listen, you must go home immediately.
Dr.
Watson and I will follow on the next train.
There's not a moment to lose, Sir Eustace is to die tonight.
Holmes.
And we should probably avoid that.
- Definitely.
- Definitely avoid that.
Little brother has taken the case, of course.
I now rely on you to keep an eye on things, but he must never suspect you are working for me.
Are you clear on that, Watson? You can rely on me, Mr.
Holmes.
- You don't suppose - I don't and neither should you.
You don't know what I was going to say.
You were about to suggest there may be some supernatural agency involved in this matter.
And I was about to laugh in your face.
But the Bride, Holmes, Emelia Ricoletti again.
A dead woman walking the earth.
You amaze me, Watson.
- I do? Since when have you had any kind of imagination? Perhaps since I convinced the reading public that an unprincipled drug addict was some kind of gentleman hero.
Yes, now you come to mention it, that was quite impressive.
You may, however, rest assured there are no ghosts in this world.
Save those we make for ourselves.
Sorry, what did you say? Ghosts we make for ourselves, what do you mean? Somnambulism.
I beg your pardon? I sleepwalk, that's all.
It's a common enough condition.
I thought you were a doctor! The whole thing was a bad dream.
Including the contents of the envelope you received? Well, that's a grotesque joke.
Well, that's not the impression you gave your wife, sir.
- She's an hysteric, prone to fancies.
- No.
- I'm sorry, what did you say? - I said no, she's not an hysteric.
She's a highly intelligent woman of rare perception.
My wife sees terror in an orange pip.
Your wife can see worlds where no-one else can see anything of value whatsoever.
Can she really? And how do you "deduce" that, Mr.
Holmes? She married you.
I assume she was capable of finding a reason.
I'll do my best to save your life tonight, but first it would help if you would explain your connection to the Ricoletti case.
Ricoletti? Yes.
In detail, please.
I've never heard of her.
Interesting.
I didn't mention she was a woman.
We'll show ourselves out.
I hope to see you again in the morning.
You will not.
Then sadly I shall be solving your murder.
Good day.
Well, you tried.
Will you see that Lady Carmichael receives this.
Thank you.
- Good afternoon.
- Certainly, sir.
What was that? Lady Carmichael will sleep alone tonight, upon the pretence of a violent headache.
All the doors and windows of the house will be locked.
Ha! You think the spectre, er, Bride, will attempt to lure Sir Eustace outside again? Certainly.
Why else the portentous threat? - "This night you will die!" - Well, he won't follow her, surely? Hmm, it's difficult to say quite what he'll do.
- Guilt is eating away at his soul.
- Guilt? About what? Something in his past.
The orange pips were a reminder.
- Not a joke? - Not at all.
Orange pips are a traditional warning of avenging death, originating in America.
Sir Eustace knows this only too well, just as he knows why he is to be punished.
Something to do with Emelia Ricoletti? I presume.
We all have a past, Watson.
Ghosts.
They are the shadows that define our every sunny day.
Sir Eustace knows he's a marked man.
There's something more than murder he fears.
He believes he is to be dragged to hell by the risen corpse of the late Mrs.
Ricoletti.
That's a lot of nonsense, isn't it? God, yes.
Did you bring your revolver? What good would that be against a ghost? - Exactly.
Did you bring it? - Yeah, of course.
Then come, Watson, come.
The game is afoot.
- Get down, Watson, for heaven's sake! - Sorry.
Cramp.
- Is the lamp still burning? - Yes.
There goes Sir Eustace.
And Lady Carmichael.
The house sleeps.
Hmm, good God, this is the longest night of my life.
Have patience, Watson.
Only midnight.
You know, it's rare for us to sit together like this.
I should hope so.
It's murder on the knees.
Two old friends just talking.
Chewing the fat.
Man-to-man.
So, a remarkable woman.
- Who? - Lady Carmichael.
The fair sex is your department, Watson.
I'll take your word for it.
Well, you liked her.
"A woman of rare perception.
" And admirably high arches.
I noticed them as soon as she stepped into the room.
- Huh, she's far too good for him.
- You think so? No.
You think so.
I could tell.
On the contrary, I have no view on the matter.
Yes, you have.
Marriage is not a subject upon which I dwell.
Oh, why not? What's the matter with you this evening? That watch that you're wearing, there's a photograph inside it.
I glimpsed it once.
I believe it is of Irene Adler.
You didn't glimpse it, you waited till I'd fallen asleep - and looked at it.
- Yes, I did.
- You seriously thought I wouldn't notice? - Irene Adler.
Formidable opponent, a remarkable adventure.
- A very nice photograph.
- Why are you talking like this? - Why are you so determined to be alone? - Are you quite well, Watson? - Is it such a curious question? - From a Viennese alienist, no.
From a retired Army surgeon, most certainly.
Holmes, against absolutely no opposition whatsoever, I am your closest friend.
I concede it.
I am currently attempting to have a perfectly normal conversation with you.
- Please don't.
- Why do you need to be alone? If you are referring to romantic entanglement, Watson, which I rather fear you are, as I have often explained before, all emotion is abhorrent to me.
It is the grit in a sensitive instrument.
- The crack in the lens.
- The crack in the lens.
Yes.
Well, there you are, you see, I've said it all before.
No, I wrote all that.
You're quoting yourself from The Strand Magazine.
- Well, exactly.
- Those are my words, not yours! That is the version of you that I present to the public.
The brain without a heart.
The calculating machine.
I write all of that, Holmes, and the readers lap it up.
But I do not believe it.
Well, I've a good mind to write to your editor.
You are a living, breathing man.
- You've lived a life, you have a past.
- A what?! - Well, you must have had - Had what? - You know.
- No.
Experiences.
Pass me your revolver, I have a sudden need to use it.
Damn it, Holmes, you are flesh and blood, you have feelings, you have You must have Impulses.
Dear Lord, I have never been so impatient to be attacked by a murderous ghost.
As your friend, as someone who worries about you .
.
what made you like this? Oh, Watson Nothing made me.
I made me.
Redbeard? Good God! What are we to do? Why don't we have a chat? Mrs.
Ricoletti, I believe! A pleasant night for the time of year, is it not? It cannot be true, Holmes, it cannot! No, it can't.
- Is it locked? - As per instruction.
That was a window breaking, wasn't it? There's only one broken window we need concern ourselves with.
- Stay here, Watson.
- What? No.
All the doors and windows to the house are locked.
This is their only way out, I need you here! But the sound was so close.
It had to be from this side of the house.
Stay here! Oh! No! You promised to keep him safe.
You promised! You You're human, I know that.
You must be.
Little use us standing here in the dark.
After all, this is the 19th century.
Do not forget me! Do not forget me! Watson! - She's there! She's down there! - Don't tell me you abandoned your post! What? Holmes, she's there, I saw her! Empty, thanks to you! Our bird is flown! No! No, Holmes, it wasn't what you think.
I saw her! The ghost! There are no ghosts! What happened? Where is Sir Eustace? Dead.
You really mustn't blame yourself, you know.
No, you're quite right.
- I'm glad you're seeing sense.
Watson is equally culpable.
Between us, we've managed to botch this whole case.
I gave an undertaking to protect that man, now he's lying there with a dagger in his breast.
In fact, you gave an undertaking to investigate his murder.
In the confident expectation I would not have to! Anything you can tell us, Doctor? Well, he's been stabbed with considerable force.
- It's a man, then? - Possibly.
A very keen blade, so it could conceivably have been a woman? In theory, yes, but we know who it was, I saw her.
- Watson! - I saw the ghost, with my own eyes! You saw nothing! You saw what you were supposed to see! You said yourself, I have no imagination.
Then use your brain, such as it is, to eliminate the impossible, which in this case is the ghost, and observe what remains, which in this case is a solution so blindingly obvious even Lestrade could work it out! Thank you! Forget spectres from the other world! There is only one suspect with motive and opportunity.
- They might as well have left a note.
- They did leave a note.
And then there's the matter of the other broken window.
- What other broken window? - Precisely! There isn't one.
The only broken window is the one that Watson and I entered through, yet, prior to that, we distinctly heard the sound of - What did you just say? - Sorry? About a note, what did you just say? - I said the murderer DID leave a note.
- No, they didn't.
There's a message tied to the dagger.
You must have seen it! - There's no message.
- Yes! There was no message when I found the body.
Holmes? What is it? Do you? Do I what? H-how did you get that? I left it at the crime scene.
"Crime scene"? Where do you pick up these extraordinary expressions? Do you miss him? Moriarty is dead.
And yet? His body was never recovered.
To be expected when one pushes a maths professor over a waterfall.
Pure reason toppled by sheer melodrama.
Your life in a nutshell.
Where do you pick up these extraordinary expressions? Have you put on weight? - You saw me only yesterday.
- Does that seem possible? - No.
- Yet here I am, increased.
What does that tell the foremost criminal investigator in England? In England? You're in deep, Sherlock, deeper than you ever intended to be.
- Have you made a list? - Of what? Everything.
We will need a list.
Good boy.
No, I haven't finished yet.
Moriarty may beg to differ.
He's trying to distract me.
To derail me.
Yes.
He's the crack in the lens, the fly in the ointment, the virus in the data.
I have to finish this.
If Moriarty has risen from the Reichenbach cauldron, he will seek you out.
I'll be waiting.
Yes.
I'm very much afraid you will.
Two days he's been like that.
- Has he eaten? - No, not a morsel.
Press are having a ruddy field day.
There's still reporters outside.
Oh, they've been there all the time, I can't get rid of them.
I've been rushed off my feet making tea.
Why do you make him tea? I dunno, I just sort of do.
He said, "There's only one suspect," and then he just walks away and now he won't explain.
Which is strange, because he likes that bit.
Said it was so simple I could solve it.
I'm sure he was exaggerating.
What's he doing, do you think? - He says he's waiting.
- For what? The devil.
I wouldn't be surprised.
We get all sorts here.
- Well, wire me if there's any change.
- Yeah.
Everything I have to say has already crossed your mind.
Then possibly my answer has crossed yours.
Like a bullet.
It's a dangerous habit, to finger loaded firearms in the pocket of one's dressing gown.
Or are you just pleased to see me? - You'll forgive me for taking precautions.
- I'd be offended if you didn't.
Obviously, I've returned the courtesy.
I like your rooms.
They smell so .
.
manly.
I'm sure you acquainted yourself with them before now.
Well, you are always away, on your little adventures for The Strand.
Tell me, does the illustrator travel with you? Do you have to pose during your deductions? I'm aware of all six occasions you have visited these apartments - during my absence.
- I know you are.
By the way, you have a surprisingly comfortable bed.
Did you know that dust is largely composed of human skin? Yes.
Doesn't taste the same, though, you want your skin fresh.
- Just a little crispy.
- Won't you sit down? That's all people really are, you know, dust waiting to be distributed.
And it gets everywhere.
Ugh.
In every breath you take, dancing in every sunbeam, all the used-up people.
Fascinating, I'm sure.
Won't you sit People, people, people! Can't keep anything shiny.
Do you mind if I fire this? Just to clean it out.
Exactly, let's stop playing.
We don't need toys to kill each other.
- Where's the intimacy in that? - Sit down.
- Why? What do you want? - You chose to come here.
Not true, you know that's not true.
What do you want, Sherlock? The truth.
That.
Truth's boring! You didn't expect me to turn up at the scene of the crime, did you? Poor old Sir Eustace.
He got what was coming to him.
But you couldn't have killed him.
Oh, so what? Does it matter? Stop it.
Stop this.
You don't care about Sir Eustace, or the Bride, or any of it.
There's only one thing in this whole business that you find interesting.
I know what you're doing.
The Bride put a gun in her mouth and shot the back of her head off and then she came back.
Impossible.
But she did it.
And you need to know how.
How? Don't you? It's tearing your world apart, not knowing.
You're trying to stop me To distract me, derail me.
Because doesn't this remind you of another case? Hasn't this all happened before? There's nothing new under the sun.
What was it? What was it? What was that case? Huh? Do you remember? It's on the tip of my tongue.
It's on the tip of my tongue.
It's on the tip of my tongue.
It's on the tip .
.
of my tongue.
For the sake of Mrs.
Hudson's wallpaper, I must remind you that one false move with your finger and you will be dead.
I'm sorry? Dead is the new sexy.
Well, I'll tell you what, that rather blows the cobwebs away.
- How can you be alive? - How do I look? Huh? You can be honest, is it noticeable? You blew your own brains out, how could you survive? Or maybe I could backcomb.
I saw you die.
Why aren't you dead? Because it's not the fall that kills you, Sherlock.
Of all people, you should know that, it's not the fall, it's never the fall.
It's the landing! We've landed, sir.
We've landed.
No, no, not now, not now! Not now, not now.
I trust you had a pleasant flight, sir? Well, a somewhat shorter exile than we'd imagined, brother mine, but probably adequate, given your levels of OCD.
- I have to go back! - What? I was I was nearly there, I nearly had it! What on earth are you talking about? Go back where? You didn't get very far.
Ricoletti and his abominable wife! Don't you understand?! No, of course we don't, you're not making any sense, Sherlock.
It was a case, a famous one from 100 years ago.
Lodged in my hard drive, she seemed to be dead, but then she came back.
What, like Moriarty? Shot herself in the head, exactly like Moriarty.
But you've only just been told.
We've only just found out, he's on every TV screen in the country.
Yes? So? It's been five minutes since Mycroft called.
What progress have you made? What have you been doing? More to the point, what have YOU been doing? I've been in my Mind Palace, of course.
Of course.
Running an experiment.
How would I have solved the crime, - if I'd been there in 1895? - Oh, Sherlock.
I had all the details perfect.
I was there, all of it, everything.
I was immersed.
Of course you were.
You've been reading John's blog.
The story of how you met.
It helps me if I see myself through his eyes sometimes.
I'm so much cleverer.
Do you really think anyone is believing you? No, he can do this, I've seen it.
The Mind Palace, it's like a whole world in his head.
Yes, and I need to get back there.
The Mind Palace is a memory technique, I know what it can do and I know what it most certainly cannot.
Maybe there are one or two things that I know that you don't.
Oh, there are.
Did you make a list? You've put on weight.
That waistcoat is clearly newer than the jacket.
Stop this! Just stop it! Did you make a list?! Of what? Everything, Sherlock.
Everything you've taken.
No, it's not that, he goes into a sort of trance.
I've seen him do it.
We have an agreement, my brother and I, ever since that day.
Wherever I find him, whatever back alley or doss-house .
.
there will always be a list.
He couldn't have taken all that in the last five minutes.
- He was high before he got on the plane.
- He didn't seem high.
- Nobody deceives like an addict.
- I'm not an addict, I'm a user.
I alleviate boredom and occasionally heighten my thought processes.
For God's sake! This could kill you! - You could die! - Controlled usage is not usually fatal and abstinence is not immortality.
What are you doing? Emelia Ricoletti, I'm looking her up.
Oh, I suppose we should.
I have access to the top level of the MI5 archive.
Yep, that's where I'm looking.
What do you think of MI5 security? I think it would be a good idea.
Emelia Ricoletti, "unsolved", like he says.
Could you all just shut up for five minutes! I have to go back.
I was nearly there before you stepped on and started yapping away! "Yapping?" Sorry, did we interrupt your session? - Sherlock, listen to me.
- No, it only encourages you.
- I'm not angry with you.
- Oh, that's a relief! I was really worried No, hold on, I really wasn't.
I was there for you before.
I'll be there for you again.
I'll always be there for you.
This was my fault.
It was nothing to do with you.
A week in a prison cell, I should have realised.
- Realised what? - That, in your case, solitary confinement is locking you up with your worst enemy.
- Oh, for God's sake! - Morphine or cocaine? - What did you say? - I didn't say anything.
No, you did, you said 'Which is it today? Morphine or cocaine.
' 'Holmes?' Morphine or cocaine which is it today? Answer me, damn it! Moriarty was here.
Moriarty's dead.
- I was on a jet.
- A what? You were there, and Mycroft.
You haven't left these rooms, Holmes.
You haven't moved.
Now, tell me, morphine or cocaine? Cocaine.
A 7% solution.
- Would you care to try it? - No.
But I would quite like to find every ounce of the stuff in your possession and pour it out of the window.
I should be inclined to stop you.
Then you would be reminded, quite forcibly, which of us is a soldier and which of us a drug addict.
You're not a soldier, you are a doctor.
I'm an army doctor, which means I could break every bone in your body while naming them.
My dear Watson, you are allowing emotion to cloud your judgment.
Never on a case.
You promised me, never on a case.
No, I just said that in one of your stories.
Listen, I'm happy to play the fool for you.
I will run along behind you like some halfwit, making you look clever, if that's what you need.
But dear God above, you will hold yourself to a higher standard! - Why? - Because people need you to.
What people, why? Because of your idiot stories? Yes, because of my "idiot stories".
Mr.
Holmes! Mr.
Holmes, telegram, Mr.
Holmes.
What is it? What's wrong? - It's Mary.
- Mary? What about her? - It's entirely possible she's in danger.
- Danger? - There's not a moment to lose.
- Is this the cocaine talking? What danger could Mary be in? I'm sure she's just visiting with friends.
Come on! What is happening? Are you even in a fit state? For Mary, of course.
Never doubt that, Watson.
Never that.
Holmes? I'm fine.
I'm fine! Not that one! This one.
Why? You're Sherlock Holmes.
Wear the damn hat.
Cab! Cab! So tell me, where is she? You must tell me, what's going on?! Oh, good old Watson! How would we fill the time if you didn't ask questions?! Sherlock, tell me where my bloody wife is, you pompous prick, or I'll punch your lights out! Holmes, where is she? A de-sanctified church.
She thinks she's found the solution and, for no better reason than that, she's put herself in the path of considerable danger.
What an excellent choice of wife.
What the devil?! I've found them.
- What is all this, Mary? - This is the heart of it all, John.
The heart of the conspiracy.
Great God, what is this place? And what the devil are you doing here?! I've been making enquiries.
Mr.
Holmes asked me.
Holmes, how could you? No, not him, the clever one.
It seemed obvious to me that this business could not be managed alone.
My theory is that Mrs.
Ricoletti had help.
Help from her friends.
- Bravo, Mary.
- "The clever one?" I I thought I was losing you.
I thought perhaps we were - neglecting each other.
- Well, you're the one who moved out.
I was talking to Mary.
You're working for Mycroft? He likes to keep an eye on his mad sibling.
And he had a spy to hand.
Has it never occurred to you your wife is excessively skilled for a nurse? Of course it hasn't, because he knows what a nurse is capable of.
- When did it occur to you? - Only now, I'm afraid.
Must be difficult, being the slow little brother.
Time I sped up.
Enough chatter, let's concentrate.
Yes, all right.
What's all this about? - What do they want to accomplish? - Why don't we go and find out.
Sorry! I can never resist a gong.
- Or a touch of the dramatic.
- Never have guessed! Though it seems you share my enthusiasm in that regard.
Excellent.
Superlative theatre.
I applaud the spectacle.
Emelia Ricoletti shot herself, then apparently returned from the grave and killed her husband.
So how was it done? Let's take the events in order.
Mrs.
Ricoletti gets everyone's attention in very efficient fashion.
You! You?! Or me? She places one of the revolvers in her mouth, while actually firing the other into the ground.
An accomplice sprays the curtains with blood and thus her apparent suicide is witnessed by the frightened crowd below.
A substitute corpse, bearing a strong resemblance to Mrs.
Ricoletti takes her place and is later transported to the morgue, a grubby little suicide of little interest to Scotland Yard.
Meanwhile, the real Mrs.
Ricoletti slips away.
Now comes the really clever part.
Mrs.
Ricoletti persuaded a cab driver, someone who knew her, to intercept her husband outside his favourite opium den.
The perfect stage for a perfect drama.
Who are you? What do you want? Emelia? Help! A perfect positive identification.
The late Mrs.
Ricoletti has returned from the grave and a little skilled make-up and you have nothing less than the wrath of a vengeful ghost.
There was only one thing left to do.
Swiftly now.
No tears.
All that remained was to substitute the real Mrs.
Ricoletti for the corpse in the morgue.
This time, should anyone attempt to identify her, it would be positively, absolutely her.
But why would she do that? Die to prove a point? Every great cause has martyrs.
Every war has suicide missions and make no mistake, this is war.
One half of the human race at war with the other.
The invisible army hovering at our elbow, tending to our homes, raising our children.
Ignored, patronised, disregarded.
Not allowed so much as a vote.
But an army nonetheless, ready to rise up in the best of causes.
To put right an injustice as old as humanity itself.
So you see, Watson, Mycroft was right.
This is a war we must lose.
She was dying.
- Who was? - Emelia Ricoletti.
There were clear signs of consumption I doubt she was long for this world.
So she decided to make her death count.
She was already familiar with the secret societies of America.
And was able to draw on their methods of fear and intimidation to publicly, very publicly, confront Sir Eustace Carmichael with the sins of his past.
He knew her out in the States.
Promised her everything.
Marriage, position.
And then he had his way with her .
.
and threw her over.
Left her abandoned and penniless.
Hooper! Holmes.
For the record, Holmes, she didn't have me fooled.
Why do you never mention me, sir? Emelia thought that she'd found happiness with Ricoletti, but he was a brute too.
Emelia Ricoletti was our friend.
You have no idea how that bastard treated her.
But the Bride, Holmes, we saw her.
Yes, Watson, we did.
The sound of breaking glass? Not a window, just an old theatrical trick.
- It cannot be true, Holmes, it cannot! - No, it can't.
'It's called Pepper's Ghost.
'A simple reflection in glass of a living, breathing person.
'Their only mistake was breaking the glass when they removed it.
' Look around you.
This room is full of brides.
Once she had risen, anyone could be her.
The avenging ghost.
A legend to strike terror into the heart of any man with malicious intent.
A spectre to stalk those unpunished brutes whose reckoning is long overdue.
A league of furies awakened.
The women I WE have lied to, betrayed.
The women we have ignored and disparaged.
Once the idea exists, it cannot be killed.
This is the work of a single-minded person.
Someone who knew first-hand about Sir Eustace's mental cruelty.
The dark secret, kept from all but her closest friends, including Emelia Ricoletti .
.
the woman her husband wronged all those years before.
If one disregards the ghost, there is only one suspect.
Isn't that right, Lady Carmichael? One small detail doesn't quite make sense to me, however.
Why engage me to prevent a murder you intended to commit? Hmm? "Doesn't quite make sense, doesn't quite make sense.
" Of course it doesn't make sense, it's not real.
Oh, Sherlock.
Peek-a-boo.
No.
No, not you.
It can't be you.
I mean, come on, be serious.
The costumes, the gong? Speaking as a criminal mastermind, we don't really have gongs or special outfits.
What the hell is going on? Is this silly enough for you yet? Gothic enough? Mad enough, even for you? It doesn't make sense, Sherlock, because it's not real.
- None of it.
- What's he talking about? This is all in your mind.
Sherlock? Holmes! You're dreaming.
- Argh! - Is he dreaming? And there he is.
Thought we'd lost you for a moment.
May I just check, is this what you mean by "controlled usage"? Mrs.
Emelia Ricoletti, I need to know where she was buried.
- What, 120 years ago? - Yes.
That would take weeks to find, if those records even exists.
- Even with my resources.
- Got it.
I don't get it, how is this relevant? I need to know I was right, then I'll be sure.
- You mean how Moriarty did it? - Yes.
But none of that really happened, it was in your head.
My investigation was the fantasy, the crime happened exactly as I explained.
The stone was erected by a group of her friends.
I don't know what you think you'll find here.
I need to try! Mrs.
Ricoletti was buried here, but what happened to the other one? The corpse they substituted for her after the so-called suicide? - They'd move it, of course they would.
- But where? Well, not here.
But that That's exactly what they must have done.
The conspirators had someone on the inside.
They found a body, just like Molly Hooper found a body for me, when Yeah, well, we don't need to go into all that again, do we? You're not seriously going to do this? It's why we came here.
I need to know.
Spoken like an addict.
- This is important to me! - No, this is you needing a fix.
John Moriarty's back.
We have a case, we have a real-life problem right now.
Getting to that, it's next on the list.
Just let me do this.
No, everyone always lets you do whatever you want.
- That's how you got in this state! - John, please I'm not playing this time, Sherlock.
Not any more! When you're ready to go to work, give me a call.
- I'm taking Mary home.
- You're what? - Mary's taking me home.
- Better.
- He's right, you know.
- So what if he's right?! He's always right, it's boring! Will you help me? Cherchez la femme.
Eurgh! Oh, dear.
The cupboard is bare.
They must have buried it underneath.
They must have buried it underneath the coffin.
Bad luck, Sherlock.
Maybe they got rid of the body in another way.
No More than likely.
At any rate, it was a very long time ago.
We do have slightly more pressing matters to hand, little brother.
Moriarty? Back from the dead? VOICE): 'Do not forget me.
'Do not forget me!' This? Oh, I see.
Still not awake, am I? Too deep, Sherlock, way too deep.
Congratulations, you will be the first man in history to be buried in his own Mind Palace.
The setting is a shade melodramatic, don't you think? For you and me? Not at all.
What are you? You know what I am.
I'm Moriarty.
The Napoleon of Crime.
- Moriarty's dead! - Not in your mind.
I'll never be dead there.
You once called your brain a hard drive.
Well, say hello to the virus.
This is how we end, you and I.
Always here, always together.
You have a magnificent brain, Moriarty.
I admire it.
I concede it may even be the equal of my own.
I'm touched.
I'm honoured.
But when it comes to the matter of unarmed combat on the edge of a precipice .
.
you're going in the water, short-arse.
Oh, you think you're so big and strong, Sherlock! Not with me.
I am your weakness! I keep you down! Every time you stumble, every time you fail, when you're weak, I am there! No, don't try to fight it.
Lie back and lose! Shall we go over together? It has to be together, doesn't it? At the end it's always just you and me! Professor, if you wouldn't mind stepping away from my friend, I do believe he finds your attention a shade annoying.
That's not fair, there's two of you! There's always two of us.
Don't you read The Strand? On your knees, Professor.
Hands behind your head.
Thank you, John.
Since when do you call me John? You'd be surprised.
No, I wouldn't.
Time you woke up, Sherlock.
I'm a story-teller, I know when I'm in one.
Of course.
Of course you do, John.
So what's he like? The other me in the other place? Smarter than he looks.
Pretty damn smart, then.
Pretty damn smart.
Ugh, why don't you two just elope, for God's sake?! Impertinent.
Offensive.
Actually, would you mind? Not at all.
- It was my turn.
- Quite so.
So how do you plan to wake up? Oh I should think like this.
Are you sure? Between you and me, John, I always survive a fall.
But how? Elementary, my dear Watson.
- Miss me? - Sherlock, are you all right? Yes.
Of course I am, why wouldn't I be? Because you probably just OD'd.
You should be in hospital.
Hm, no time.
I have to go to Baker Street now, Moriarty's back.
I almost hope he is, if it'll save you from this.
No need for that now, I've got the real thing.
- I have work to do.
- Sherlock .
.
promise me.
What are you still doing here? Shouldn't you be off getting me a pardon or something, like a proper big brother? Dr.
Watson Look after him.
Please.
Sherlock, hang on, explain.
Moriarty's alive, then? I never said he was alive, I said he was back.
So he's dead? Of course he's dead, he blew his own brains out, no-one survives that.
I just went to the trouble of an overdose to prove it.
Moriarty is dead, no question.
But more importantly, I know exactly what he's going to do next.
Flying machines, these, er, telephone contraptions? What sort of lunatic fantasy is that? It was simply my conjecture of what a future world might look like and how you and I might fit inside it.
From a drop of water a logician should be able to infer the possibility of an Atlantic or a Niagara.
Or a Reichenbach? Have you written up your account of the case? - Yes.
- Hmm.
Modified to put it down as one of my rare failures, of course? Of course.
The Adventure Of The Invisible Army.
The League Of Furies? The Monstrous Regiment? I rather thought The Abominable Bride.
A trifle lurid.
It'll sell.
It's got proper murders in it too.
You're the expert.
As for your own tale, are you sure it's still just a 7% solution that you take? I think you may have increased the dosage.
Perhaps I was being a little fanciful.
But perhaps such things could come to pass.
In any case, I know I would be very much at home in such a world.
- Huh, I don't think I would be.
- I beg to differ.
But then I've always known I was a man out of his time.
- My brother is a murderer.
No chance for you to be a hero this time, Mr Holmes.
Oh, do your research.
I'm not a hero.
I'm a high-functioning sociopath.
Merry Christmas! [GUNSHOT] I'm not given to outbursts of brotherly compassion.
You know what happened to the other one.
Miss me? 'Did you miss me? Did you miss me? Did you miss me?' I've only been gone four minutes.
Well, I certainly hope you've learnt your lesson.
What you're about to see is classified beyond top secret.
Is that quite clear? Don't minute any of this.
Once beyond these walls, you must never speak of it.
A D notice has been slapped on the entire incident.
Only those within this room, code names Antarctica, Langdale, Porlock and Love, will ever know the whole truth.
As far as everyone else is concerned, going to the Prime Minister - and way beyond, Charles Augustus - [PHONE KEYBOARD CLICKS] - Are you tweeting?! - No.
Well, that's what it looks like! Of course I'm not tweeting.
Why would I be tweeting? - Give me that! - What? No! What are you doing?! - Get off! - Give it here! - "Back on terra firma.
" - Don't read them out.
- "Free as a bird.
" - God, you're such a spoilsport.
Will you take this matter seriously, Sherlock? I am! What makes you think I'm not taking it seriously? "#OhWhatABeautifulMorning" Look, not so long ago I was on a mission that meant certain death - my death! And now I'm back, in a nice warm office, with my big brother and Are those ginger nuts? - Oh, God - Love ginger nuts.
Our doctor said you were clean.
I am.
Utterly.
No need for stimulants now, remember? I have work to do.
You're high as a kite! Natural high, I assure you.
Totally natural.
I'm just .
.
glad to be alive! What shall we do next? What's your name? Vivian.
- What would you do, Vivian? - Pardon? Well, it's a lovely day.
Go for a stroll? Make a paper aeroplane? Have an ice lolly? Ice lolly, I suppose.
Ice lolly it is! - What's your favourite? - Well, really, I shouldn't - Go on.
- Do they still do Mivvies? - Mr Holmes - Yes? - we do need to get on.
- Yes, of course.
[HELICOPTER WHIRS] 'Do your research.
'I'm not a hero.
I'm a high-functioning sociopath.
[GUNSHOT] - .
.
sociopath.
- [GUNSHOT] - .
.
sociopath.
' - [GUNSHOT] I see.
Who is supposed to have shot him, then? Some over-eager squaddie with an itchy trigger finger - that's who.
- That's not what happened at all.
- It is now.
Remarkable.
How did you do it? We have some very talented people working here.
If James Moriarty can hack every TV screen in the land, rest assured we have the tech to doctor a bit of security footage.
That is now the official version, the version anyone we want to will see.
No need to go to the trouble of getting some sort of official pardon.
You're off the hook, Mr Holmes.
You're home and dry.
OK, cheers.
Obviously, there's unfinished business.
Moriarty.
I told you - Moriarty's dead.
You say he filmed that video message before he died.
Yes.
You also say you know what he's going to do next.
- What does that mean? - Perhaps that's all there is to it.
Perhaps he was just trying to frighten you.
No, no, he would never be that disappointing.
He's planned something, something long-term.
Something that would take effect if he never made it off that rooftop alive.
Posthumous revenge.
No, better than that - posthumous game.
We brought you back to deal with this.
- What are you going to do? - Wait.
Wait?! Of course wait.
I'm the target - targets wait.
Look, whatever's coming, whatever he's lined up, I'll know when it begins.
I always know when the game is on.
Do you know why? Why? Because I love it.
There was once a merchant, in the famous market at Baghdad.
- [WATER SLOSHES] - One day he saw a stranger looking at him in surprise, and he knew that the stranger was Death.
Pale and trembling, the merchant fled the marketplace and made his way many, many miles, to the city of Samarra.
For there he was sure Death could not find him.
But when, at last, he came to Samarra, the merchant saw, waiting for him, the grim figure of Death.
"Very well," said the merchant.
"I give in.
I am yours.
" "But tell me, why did you look surprised when you saw me this morning in Baghdad?" "Because," said Death, "I had an appointment with you tonight .
.
in Samarra.
" If this gets any better, I'm going to get two knives.
Pays to advertise.
- So, what about Moriarty, then? - Oh, I have a plan.
I'm going to monitor the underworld, every quiver of the web will tell me when the spider makes his move.
So, basically, your plan is just to sit there solving crimes like you always do? Awesome, isn't it? He drowned, Mr Holmes.
That's what we thought.
- But when they opened up his lungs - Yes? .
.
sand.
- Superficial.
- [PHONE WHISTLES] Come back! It's the wrong thumb.
[DOOR SLAMS] - Sherlock - It's never twins.
Hopkins, arrest Wilson.
Dimmock, look in the lymph nodes.
- 'Wilson?' 'Lymph nodes?' - Sherlock Yes, you may have nothing but a limbless torso, but there'll be traces of ink in the lymph nodes under the armpits.
If your mystery corpse had tattoos, the signs will be there.
- 'Bloody hell! Is that a guess?' - I never guess.
- Sherlock - 'So, he's the killer? The canary trainer?' - Of course he's the killer.
- 'Didn't see that coming.
' Hm, naturally.
Sherlock, you can't go on spinning plates like this.
That's it! The place was spinning.
The heart medication you're taking is known to cause bouts of amnesia.
Yes, I I think so.
Why? Because the fingerprints on your brother's neck were your own.
- [WATSON CHUCKLES] A jellyfish? - I know.
You can't arrest a jellyfish.
- You could try.
- We did try.
- [PHONE REPEATEDLY VIBRATES] - Oh - Oh, God.
- Mary? 59 missed calls.
We're in a lot of trouble.
[MARY SCREAMS] Ow! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Relax, it's got two syllables I'm a nurse, darling - I think I know what to do! - Come on, then - Re! Lax! No, just drive, please, God, just drive! God, drive! - [SHE SCREAMS] - Sherlock - Mary! - That's it, Mary - re - [PHONE KEYBOARD CLICKS] - Don't you start! - lax.
John, John I think you have to pull over! - Mary, Mary - Pull over! - Oh, my God! - [MARY SCREAMS] Has that come out? They never come out when I take them.
Let's have a look.
Aw, she's so beautiful.
- Have another go.
- What about a name? - Catherine.
- Uh, yeah, we've gone off that.
Have we? - Yeah.
- Oh.
- Well, you know what I think - BOTH: It's not a girl's name.
Molly, Mrs H, we would love you to be godparents.
- Oh! Really? - If you That's so lovely.
And, uh you too, Sherlock? - You too what? - Godfather, we'd like you to be godfather.
God is a ludicrous fiction, dreamt up by inadequates who abnegate all responsibility to an invisible magic friend.
Yeah, but there'll be cake.
Will you do it? I'll get back to you.
Father, we ask you to send your blessings on this water and sanctify it for our use this day.
In Christ's name.
Now, what name have you given your daughter? Rosamund Mary.
Rosamund? It means "Rose of the world".
Rosie for short.
Didn't you get John's text? No.
I delete his texts.
I delete any text that begins "Hi.
" No idea why people think you're incapable of human emotion.
- [MRS HUDSON CLEARS THROAT] - Sorry.
WHISPERING: Phone! And now, godparents, are you ready to help the parents of this child in their duties as Christian parents? BOTH: We are.
SIRI: 'Sorry, I didn't catch that.
'Please repeat the question.
' As ever, Watson, you see but do not observe.
To you, the world remains an impenetrable mystery, whereas, to me, it is an open book.
Hard logic versus romantic whimsy - that is your choice.
You fail to connect actions to their consequences.
Now, for the last time, if you want to keep the rattle, do not throw the rattle.
[MESSAGE TONE] All right, good girl, good girl.
Good girl.
I'd better finish this, hadn't I? - Hey.
- Afternoon.
He says you've got a good one, Greg? Oh, yeah.
It was David Welsborough's 50th birthday.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] God, 50! Where does it go? I know for a fact I was only 21 this time last week.
Yeah, well that's impossible.
That was before you met me.
- Well, no, no, there never was - "There never was such a time.
" She's looking at me disapprovingly again.
No.
She's just jealous.
Yeah, well, I think we both are.
[PHONE VIBRATES] - Oh - No, no, David.
- Come on, you promised.
- No, it's Oh, no Oh, it's a Skype call.
Oh! Then it must be Charlie.
At least he's phoning, I suppose.
Oh, look! Hello! 'Hey, Dad.
Happy birthday.
Sorry to miss the party, but travel broadens the mind, right?' No! Picture's frozen! 'Yeah, signal's rubbish.
But I can still hear you.
' Why is it rubbish? Where are you? How is he? Is he eating? Ask him if he's eating.
MAN: David? Come on! OK, no, hang on a sec, I'll find somewhere quieter.
So, Charlie, where are you? Are you there? - 'Sorry, I'm here.
I'm just a bit' - Are you all right? 'It's nothing.
Probably just the altitude.
' Altitude? 'I'm in Tibet.
Didn't you see the mountains?' Never mind mountains.
Your mother wants to know if you're eating properly.
- 'Listen, Dad, could you do me a favour?' - What? 'Could you just check something on my car?' Your car? 'To settle a bet.
The guys here don't believe I've got a Power Ranger stuck to the bonnet.
- 'Could you take a photo and send it?' - Uh, yes, I can do that.
All done.
Have you got it? Charlie? LESTRADE: A week later Yeah? something really weird happens.
Drunk driver, he's totally smashed, the cops are chasing him, and he turns into the drive of the Welsborough house to try and get away.
Unfortunately The drunk guy survived, they managed to pull him out, but when they put the fire out and examined the parked car Whose body? Charlie Welsborough, the son.
- What? - The son who was in Tibet.
DNA all checks out.
Night of the party, the car's empty, and a week later the dead boy's found at the wheel.
[SHERLOCK CHUCKLES] - Yeah, I thought it'd tickle you.
- Have you got a lab report? Yeah, Charlie Welsborough's the son of a Cabinet Minister, so I'm under a lot of pressure to get a result.
Who cares about that? Tell me about the seats.
- The seats? - Yes, the car seats.
Made of vinyl.
Two different types of vinyl present.
Was it his own car? Yeah, not flash - he was a student.
- Well, that's suggestive.
- Why? - Vinyl's cheaper than leather.
- Yeah, right? - There's something else.
- Yes? According to this, Charlie Welsborough had already been dead for a week.
What? The body in the car, dead for a week.
Oh, this is a good one.
Is it my birthday? You want help? - Yes, please.
OK.
- One condition.
Take all the credit.
It gets boring if I just solve them all.
Yeah, you say that, but then John blogs about it, and you get all the credit anyway.
He's got a point.
Which makes me look like some kind of prima donna who insists on getting credit for something he didn't do! Well, I think you've hit a sore spot, Sherlock.
- Like I'm some kind of credit junkie.
- Definitely a sore spot.
So you take all the glory, thanks - OK! - thanks all the same.
Look, just solve the bloody thing, will you? It's driving me nuts.
Anything you say, Giles.
Just kidding.
HE MOUTHS: What's his name? HE MOUTHS: Greg.
What? Greg.
It's obvious though, isn't it, what happened? John, you amaze me.
You know what happened? Not a clue.
It's just you normally say that at this point.
Hmm.
Well, then, let's hope you solve your little problem, Greg.
- Hear that? - I know.
- So, how's it going then, fatherhood? - Oh, good, great.
Yeah, amazing.
- Getting any sleep? - Christ, no.
You're at the beck and call of a screaming, demanding baby, woken up at all hours to obey its every whim.
- Must feel very different - Sorry, what? Yes, well, you know how it is.
All you do is clean up their mess, pat them on the head.
- Are you two having a little joke? - Never a word of thanks.
Can't even tell people's faces apart.
This is a joke, isn't it? Yeah, and it's all, "Oh, aren't you clever.
You're so, so clever.
" - Is it about me? - I think he needs winding.
You know, I think that really might be it.
No, don't get it.
Charlie's family are pretty cut up about it, as you'd expect, so go easy on them, yeah? - You know me.
- MARY: 'Hey, hello.
' Yeah.
Got them, don't worry.
Pampers, the cream you can't get from Boots.
Yeah, never mind about that.
Where are you now? - At the dead boy's house? - Yeah.
'And what does he think? Any theories?' Well, I texted you the details.
Yeah, two different types of vinyl.
- Hey! - How do you know about that? 'Oh you'd be amazed at what a receptionist picks up.
' - WHISPERING: They know everything! - 'Solved it, then?' I'm working on it.
'Oh, Mary, motherhood's slowing you down.
' - Pig! - Keep trying.
'So, what about it, then? 'What, an empty car that suddenly has a week-old corpse in it? 'And what are you going to call this one?' Oh, the Ghost Driver.
- Don't give it a title.
- People like the titles.
- They hate the titles.
- Give the people what they want.
No, never do that - people are stupid.
Uh, some people.
'All people are stupid.
Most people.
' 'Bizarre enough though, isn't it, to be him?' I mean, it's right up your strasse.
Mr and Mrs Welsborough, I really am most terribly sorry to hear about your daughter.
- Son.
- Son! Mr and Mrs Welsborough, this is Mr Sherlock Holmes.
Thank you very much for coming.
We've heard a great deal about you.
If anyone can throw any light into this darkness, surely it will be you.
Well, I believe that I can.
DISTORTED: But Charlie was our whole world, Mr Holmes.
I Sherlock? Mr Holmes? Sorry, you were saying? Well, Charlie was our whole world, Mr Holmes.
I I don't think we'll ever get over this.
No.
Shouldn't think so.
So sorry, will you excuse me a moment? I just I'll I'll just, um Ahem.
- Now what's wrong? - Not sure, I just By the pricking of my thumbs.
Seriously? You? Intuitions are not to be ignored, John.
They represent data processed too fast for the conscious mind to comprehend.
What is this? Oh, it's a sort of shrine, I suppose, really.
Bit of a fan of Mrs T.
A big hero of mine when I was getting started.
Right, yes.
- Who? - What? - Who? Who was this? - Are you serious? - Sherlock - It's It's Margaret Thatcher, the first female Prime Minister of this country.
Right.
- Prime Minister? Right.
- Leader of the Government.
- Female? - For God's sake! You know perfectly well who she is.
Why are you playing for time? It's the gap, look at the gap.
It's wrong.
Everything else is perfectly ordered, managed.
The whole thing's verging on OCD.
My respects.
This figurine is routinely repositioned after the cleaner's been in, this picture is straightened every day, yet this ugly gap remains.
- Something's missing from here, but only recently.
- Yes, a - Plaster bust - plaster bust.
- Oh, for God's sake! It got broken.
What the hell has this got to do with Charlie? - Rug! - What? Well, how could it get broken? The only place for it to fall is the floor and there is a big thick rug.
- Does it matter? - Mrs Welsborough, my apologies.
- It is worth letting him do this.
- Is your friend quite mad? No, he's an arsehole, but it's an easy mistake.
Look, no, we had a break-in, some little bastard smashed it to bits.
We found the remains out there in the porch.
- The porch where we came in? - How anybody could hate her so much they'd go to the trouble of smashing her likeness I'm no expert, but, uh, possibly her face.
Why didn't he smash all the others? Perfect opportunity, and look at that one - she's smiling.
Oh, Inspector, this is clearly a waste of time.
- And if there's nothing - I know what happened to your son.
You do? It's quite simple, superficial, to be blunt.
But first, tell me, the night of the break-in, this room was in darkness? - Well, yes.
- And the porch where it was smashed, I noticed the motion sensor was damaged, - so I assume it's permanently lit.
- How did you notice that? I lack the arrogance to ignore details.
I'm not the police.
- So you're saying he smashed it where he could see it.
- Exactly.
- Why? - Don't know.
Wouldn't be fun if I knew.
Mr Holmes, please! It was your 50th birthday, Mr Welsborough, of course you were disappointed that your son hadn't made it back from his gap year.
- After all, he was in Tibet.
- Yes.
- No.
- No? CROWD: Happy birthday The first part of your conversation was, in fact, pre-recorded video.
Easily arranged.
It's a Skype call.
The trick was meant to be a surprise.
- A trick? - Obviously.
Could you take a photo and send it? There were two types of vinyl in the burnt-out remains of the car.
One, the actual passenger seat, the other, a good copy.
Well, good enough.
Effectively a costume.
You're joking? No, I'm not.
All he wanted was for you to get close enough to the car so he could spring the surprise.
- Oh, my God! - Surprise! That's when it happened.
I can't be certain, of course, but I think Charlie must have suffered some sort of a seizure.
You said he'd felt unwell? You all right? 'It's nothing.
Probably just the altitude.
' He died there and then.
No-one had any cause to go near his car, so there he remained, in the driver's seat, hidden, until When the two cars were examined, the fake seat had melted in the fire, revealing Charlie, who'd been sitting there, quite dead, for a week.
Oh, God! Poor kid.
Really, I'm so sorry.
Mr Welsborough, Mrs Welsborough.
This is where it was smashed.
- That was amazing.
- What? The car, the kid.
Ancient history.
Why are you still talking about it? What's so important about a broken bust of Margaret Thatcher? I can't stand it, never can.
There's a loose thread in the world.
It doesn't mean you have to pull on it.
What kind of a life would that be? Besides, I have the strangest feeling Miss me? - That's mine.
You two take a bus.
- Why? I need to concentrate, and I don't want to hit you.
The Mall, please.
- I met her once.
- Thatcher? Rather arrogant, I thought.
- You thought that?! - Ha, I know.
Why am I looking at this? That's her, John and Mary's baby.
Oh, I see, yes.
Looks very fully functioning.
Is that really the best you can do? Sorry, I've never been very good with them.
- Babies? - Humans.
Moriarty - did he have any connection with Thatcher? Any interest in her? Why on earth would he? I don't know.
You tell me.
In the last year of his life, James Moriarty was involved with four political assassinations, over 70 assorted robberies and terrorist attacks, including a chemical weapons factory in North Korea, and had latterly shown some interest in tracking down the Black Pearl of the Borgias, which is still missing, by the way, in case you feel like applying yourself to something practical.
It's a pearl - get another one.
There's something important about this.
I'm sure.
Maybe it's Moriarty.
Maybe it's not.
[WATER SLOSHES] But something's coming.
Are you having a premonition, brother mine? The world is woven from billions of lives, every strand crossing every other.
What we call premonition is just movement of the web.
If you could attenuate to every strand of quivering data, the future would be entirely calculable.
As inevitable as mathematics.
Appointment In Samarra.
I'm sorry? The merchant who can't outrun Death.
You always hated that story as a child.
Less keen on predestination back then.
I'm not sure I like it now.
You wrote your own version, as I remember.
Appointment In Sumatra.
The merchant goes to a different city and is perfectly fine.
Goodnight, Mycroft.
Then he becomes a pirate, for some reason.
- Keep me informed.
- Of what? Absolutely no idea.
'Ammo!' [MAN SHUDDERS] - Oh, hi, Stella.
- Greg.
You, uh? - Uh, yeah, he's just got a client, so - Right, right, right Uh, you see a lot of each other, do you? It's nothing.
I mean it's nothing serious.
- No, no.
- I just pop round every now and again for a chat.
Yeah, of course.
I mean he loves a really tricky case.
Yeah, he does! So what you here for? Well, Interpol think the Borgia Pearl trail leads back to London, so The Borgia Pearl? They still after that, are they? Yeah.
So, how did you two first meet? Oh, well, there was a case about, um, ten years ago.
Nobody could figure it out.
There was an old lady found dead in a sauna.
- Oh, yeah? How did she die? - Hypothermia.
What? I know, but then I met Sherlock, it was so simple the way Will you two please keep it down?! - Sorry.
- Sorry.
Now, you haven't always been in life insurance, have you? You started out in manual labour.
Don't bother being astonished.
Your right hand's almost an entire size bigger than your left - hard manual work does that.
I was a carpenter.
Like me dad.
You're trying to give up smoking - unsuccessfully - and you once had a Japanese girlfriend that meant a lot to you but now you feel indifferent about.
How the hell? Ah e-cigarettes.
Not just that - ten individual e-cigarettes.
If you just wanted to smoke indoors, you would've invested in one of those irritating electronic pipe things.
But you're convinced you can give up, so you don't want to buy a pipe, because that means you're not serious about quitting.
So instead, you buy individual cigarettes, always sure that each will be your last.
Anything to add, John? - John? - Uh, yeah, yeah, listening.
- What is that? - That is me.
Well, it's a me substitute.
Don't be so hard on yourself.
You know I value your little contributions.
Yeah? It's been there since nine this morning.
- Has it? Where were you? - Helping Mrs H with her sudoku.
What about my girlfriend? - What? - You said I had an ex You've got a Japanese tattoo in the crook of your elbow in the name Akako.
It's obvious you've tried to have it removed.
But surely that means I want to forget her, not that I'm indifferent.
If she'd really hurt your feelings, you would've had the word obliterated.
The first attempt wasn't successful, and you haven't tried again, so it seems you can live with the slightly blurred memory of Akako, hence the indifference.
I I thought you'd done something clever.
Ah, now, but now you've explained it, it's dead simple, innit? [SHERLOCK INHALES DEEPLY] I've withheld this information from you until now, Mr Kingsley, but I think it's time you knew the truth.
What do you mean? Have you ever wondered if your wife was a little bit out of your league? - Well - You thought she was having an affair.
I'm afraid it's far worse than that, your wife is a spy.
- What? - That's right.
Her real name is Greta Bengsdotter.
Swedish by birth and probably the most dangerous spy in the world.
She's been operating deep undercover for the past four years now as your wife, for one reason only, to get near the American Embassy, across the road from your flat.
Tomorrow the US President will be at the embassy, as part of an official state visit.
As the President greets members of staff, Greta Bengsdotter, disguised as a 22-stone cleaner, will inject the President in the back of the neck with a dangerous new drug, hidden inside a secret compartment inside her padded armpit.
This drug will render the President entirely susceptible to the will of that new master, none other than James Moriarty.
What? Moriarty will then use the President as a pawn to destabilise the United Nations General Assembly, which is due to vote on a nuclear non-proliferation treaty, tipping the balance in favour of a first-strike policy against Russia.
This chain of events will then prove unstoppable, thus precipitating World War III.
- Are you serious? - No, of course not.
His wife left him because his breath stinks and he likes to wear her lingerie.
I don't! - Just the bras.
- Get out.
So, what's this all about, then? - Having fun.
- Fun? - While I can.
- Mm-hmm.
[KNOCK AT DOOR] - Uh, Sherlock - Borgia Pearl.
Boring.
Go! - But - Go! - This had better be good.
- Oh, I think you'll like it.
That is the bust, isn't it? The one that was broken.
No, it's another one, different owner.
Different part of town.
You were right, this is a thing.
Something's going on.
What's wrong? I thought you'd be pleased.
- I am pleased.
- You don't look pleased.
This is my game face.
And the game is on.
Another two have been smashed since the Welsborough one.
- One belonging to Mr Mohandes Hassan.
- Identical busts? Yeah, and this one to a Dr Barnicot in Holborn.
Three in total.
God knows who'd want to do something like this.
Yeah, but some people have that complex, don't they? An idee fixe.
They obsess over one thing and they can't let it go.
No, no good.
There were other images of Margaret Margaret? You know who she is.
Thatcher, present at the first break-in.
Why would a monomaniac fixate on just one? Ooh! - What? - Blood.
Quite a bit of it, too.
Was there any injury at the crime scene? Nah.
Then our suspect must have cut themselves breaking the bust.
- Come on.
- Holborn? Lambeth! - Lambeth? Why? - To see Toby.
Ah, right.
Who? - You'll see.
- Right, are you coming? No, he's got a lunch date with a brunette forensic officer that he doesn't want to be late for.
- Who told you? - The right sleeve of your jacket, plus the formaldehyde mixed with your cologne and your complete inability to stop looking at your watch.
- Have a good time.
- I will.
Trust me, though, she's not right for you.
- What? - She's not the one.
Well, thank you, Mystic Meg.
How do you work all that out? She's got three children in Rio that he doesn't know about.
Are you just making this up? - Possibly.
- Who's Toby? There's a kid I know, hacker, brilliant hacker, one of the world's best.
Got himself into serious trouble with the Americans a couple of years ago.
He hacked into the Pentagon security system, and I managed to get him off the charge.
Therefore he owes me a favour.
So, how does that help us? - What? - Toby the hacker? - Toby's not the hacker.
- What? - All right, Craig? - All right, Sherlock? Craig's got a dog.
So I see.
Good boy! Hiya! Mary? What are you? No, we, we agreed we would never bring Rosie out on a case.
No, exactly.
So don't wait up.
- Hey, Sherlock.
- Hey.
Mary, what are you doing here? She's better at this than you.
- Better? - So I texted her.
Hang on, Mary's better than me? Well, she is a retired super-agent with a terrifying skill-set.
Of course she's better.
Yeah, OK.
Nothing personal.
What, so I'm supposed to just go home now, am I? What do you think, Sherlock? Shall we take him with us? - John or the dog? - Ha-ha, that's funny! - John.
- Well He's handy and loyal.
- That's hilarious.
- Is it too early for a divorce? Oh.
Barnicot's house, then.
Anyone up for a trudge? Keep up, he's fast.
- He's not moving.
- He's thinking.
He's really not moving.
Slow but sure, John, not dissimilar to yourself.
You just like this dog, don't you? - Well, I like you.
- He's still not moving.
- Fascinating.
- Oh! [SHE CLEARS HER THROAT] Well, what do you make of it? - They were looking for something.
- Yes, but it wasn't a burglar, they came specifically for that Thatcher bust.
Why? [DOG SNIFFS] [DOG WHINES] Clever.
Well, if you were wounded and you knew you were leaving a trail, - where would you go? - Like hiding a tree in a forest.
Or blood in a butcher's.
Never mind, Toby, better luck next time, hmm? This is it, though.
This is the one, I can feel it.
Not Moriarty? It has to be him.
It's too bizarre, it's too baroque.
It's designed to beguile me, tease me and lure me in.
At last, a noose for me to put my neck into.
You should have seen the state of the front room.
- It was like The Exorcist.
- Huh.
Was Rosie's head spinning round? - No.
Just the projectile vomiting.
- Nice! Now, you think we'd have noticed, when she was born.
- Hmm? Noticed what? - The little 666 on her forehead.
Hmm, that's The Omen.
- So? - Well, you said it was like The Exorcist.
They're two different things.
She can't be the devil and the Antichrist.
[BABY CRIES] Yeah, can't she? I'm coming, darling.
Mummy's coming.
LOVINGLY: Oh, what are you doing? What are you doing? Come here.
Have you heard of that thing? In Germany? You're going to have to be more specific, Craig.
Ostalgie.
People who missed the old days under the communists.
- People are weird, aren't they? - Hmm.
According to this, there's quite a market for Cold War memorabilia.
Thatcher, Reagan, Stalin.
Time's a great leveller, innit? Thatcher's like, I dunno, Napoleon now.
Yes, fascinating.
Irrelevant.
Where exactly did they come from? I've got into the records of the suppliers, Gelder and Co.
Seems they're from Georgia.
Where exactly? Tbilisi.
Batch of six.
One to Welsborough.
One to Hassan.
One to Dr Barnicot.
Two to Miss Orrie Harker.
One to a Mr Jack Sandeford of Reading.
Lestrade? Another one? - 'Yeah.
' - Harker or Sandeford? Harker.
And it's murder this time.
Hmm, that perks things up a bit.
Defensive wounds on her face and hands, throat cut.
Sharp blade.
The same thing inside the house? The bust? - Two of them this time.
- Interesting.
That batch of statues was made in Tbilisi several years ago.
- Limited edition of six.
- And now someone's wandering about destroying them all.
Makes no sense.
What's the point? No, they're not destroying them, that's not what's happening.
- Yes, it is.
- Well, it is, but it's not the point.
I've been slow, far too slow.
Well, I'm still being slow over here, so if you wouldn't mind Slow but lucky, very lucky.
And since they smashed both busts, our luck might just hold.
Jack Sandeford of Reading is where I'm going next.
Congratulations, by the way.
- I'm sorry? - Well, you're about to solve a big one.
- Yeah, until John publishes his blog.
- Yeah, until then, basically.
[WATER SPLASHING] That's enough now, love.
Daddy has things to do, I'm afraid.
And you need to get to bed.
Come on.
Wouldn't it be much simpler to take out your grievances at the polling station? You were on the run.
Nowhere to hide your precious cargo.
You find yourself in a workshop, plaster busts of the Iron Lady drying, it's clever.
Very clever.
But now you've met me and you're not so clever, are you? Who are you? My name is Sherlock Holmes.
Goodbye, Sherlock Holmes.
Argh! You're out of time.
- Tell me about your boss, Moriarty.
- Who? I know it's him.
It must be him.
You think you understand.
You understand nothing.
Well, before the police come in and spoil things, why don't we just enjoy the moment? Let me present Interpol's number one case.
Too tough for them, too boring for me.
The Black Pearl of the Borgias! It's not possible! How could she?! Everything about who I was is on there.
The problems of your past are your business.
The problems of your future are my privilege.
I don't understand.
She She destroyed it.
She? You know her! You do, don't you? You know the bitch?! She betrayed me.
Betrayed us all.
Mary.
This is about Mary? Is that what she's calling herself now, eh? - 'Armed police, you're surrounded!' - Give it to me.
YELLS: Give it to me! 'Come out slowly, I want to see your hands above your head.
' Nobody shoots me! Anyone shoots, I kill this man.
'Lay down your weapon.
Do it now!' I'm leaving this place.
If no-one follows me, no-one dies.
'Lay down your weapon.
' You are a policeman, I'm a professional.
Tell her she's a dead woman.
She's a dead woman walking.
She's my friend.
And she's under my protection.
Who are you? I'm the man who's going to kill your friend.
Who's Sherlock Holmes? Not a policeman.
[ALARM BLARES] What do you think? Mate in two? Don't antagonise them, darling.
Oh, what else is there to do? Chess palls after three months.
Everything palls.
They'll send someone soon.
They? Who are they? Seems to me we put an awful lot of faith in they.
Well, I've got something they would dearly love, if only we could get out of here.
I've got Ammo.
Ammo? - MARY: Madame Ambassador.
- What took you so long? - Can't get the staff.
- Everyone out, now! Veer left! [SCREAMING] [HE LAUGHS] What now? What do we do? We die.
Well? He can't have got far.
We'll have him in a bit.
- I very much doubt it.
- Why? Because I think he used to work with Mary.
[GUNFIRE] [SHOUTING IN OTHER LANGUAGE] Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Passed out again.
It's no fun when they pass out! We'll come back later.
What would he do if he knew, huh? About the English woman? What would you do to a traitor? Maybe we'll tell him one day.
If he lives that long.
[HE CHUCKLES] I am an idiot, I know nothing.
Well, I've been telling you that for ages.
That was quite a text you sent me.
What's going on, Sherlock? I was so convinced it was Moriarty, I couldn't see what was right under my nose.
Expected a pearl.
Oh, my God, that's a Yes, it's an AGRA.
Memory stick, like you gave John, except this one belongs to someone else.
Who? I don't know.
We We all had one but the others were Haven't you even looked at it yet? I glanced at it but I prefer - to hear it from you.
- Why? Because I'll know the truth when I hear it.
There were four of us, agents.
Not just agents.
Polite term.
Alex.
Gabriel.
Me.
And Ajay.
There was absolute trust between us.
The memory sticks guaranteed it.
We all had one.
Each containing aliases, our background, everything.
We could never be betrayed, because we had everything we needed to destroy the other.
- Who employed you? - Anyone who paid well.
I mean, we were at the top of our game for years.
And then it all ended.
There was a coup in Georgia.
The British Embassy in Tbilisi was taken over, lots of hostages.
We got the call to go in, get them out.
There was a change of plan, a last-minute adjustment.
- Who from? - I don't know, just another voice on the phone.
And a codeword.
- Ammo.
- Ammo? Like ammunition.
We went in, but then something went wrong.
Something went really wrong.
[GUNFIRE, SCREAMING] That was six years ago.
It feels like forever.
I was the only one that made it out.
No.
What? I met someone tonight.
Same someone who's looking for the sixth Thatcher.
Oh, my God, that's Ajay, that's him.
What, he's alive? Yeah, very much so.
I don't believe it, this is amazing! I thought I was the only one, I thought I was the only one who got out.
Where is he? I need to see him, now! Before you gave it to John, did you keep your memory stick safe? Yeah, of course.
It was our insurance.
Above all, they mustn't fall into enemy hands.
So Ajay survived as well.
And now he's looking for the memory stick he managed to hide, with all of AGRA's old aliases on it, but why? I don't know.
Tbilisi was six years ago, where's he been? Mary, I'm sorry to tell you this, but he wants you dead.
[SHE LAUGHS] Sorry, no, no, because we we were family.
Families fall out.
The memory stick is the easiest way to track you down.
You're the only other survivor, it must be you that he wants, and he's already killed looking for the Thatcher bust.
Well, he's just trying to find me.
He survived, that's all that matters! I heard it from his own mouth.
"Tell her she's a dead woman walking.
" Why would he want to kill me? - He said you betrayed him.
- Oh, no, no, that's insane.
Well, it's what he believes.
[SHE GASPS] I suppose I was always afraid this might happen.
That something in my past would come back to haunt me one day.
Yes, well, he's a very tangible ghost.
God, I just wanted a bit of peace, and I really thought I had it.
No, Mary You do.
I made a vow, remember? To look after the three of you.
Sherlock, the dragon-slayer.
Stay close to me and I will keep you safe from him, I promise you.
There's something I think you should read.
What is it? I hoped I wouldn't have to do this.
What are you? [HE SNIFFS] - Mary Oh, no! - There you go.
It's all right.
It's for the best, believe me.
No.
You just look after them till I get back.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
[CHILD SINGS] [HE GROANS] Agra? A city on the banks of the river Yamuna in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, India.
It is 378km west of the state capital, Lucknow.
What are you, Wikipedia? - Yes.
- AGRA is an acronym.
Oh, good, I love an acronym.
All the best secret societies have them.
Team of agents, the best.
But you know all that.
Of course I do.
Go on.
One of them, Ajay, is looking for Mary, also one of the team.
Indeed? Well, that's news to me.
Is it? He's already killed looking for that memory stick.
AGRA always worked for the highest bidder, I thought that might include you? - Me? - Well, I mean the British government, or whatever government you're currently propping up.
AGRA were very reliable.
Then came the Tbilisi incident.
They were sent in to free the hostages but it all went horribly wrong.
And that was that, we stopped using freelancers.
- Your initiative? - My initiative.
Freelancers are too woolly, too messy.
I don't like loose ends.
Not on my watch.
There was something else.
A detail.
A codeword.
Ammo? It's all I've got.
Little enough.
Could you do some digging as a favour? You don't have many favours left.
Then I'm calling them all in.
And if you can find who's after her and neutralise them, what then? You think you can go on saving her forever? Of course.
Is that sentiment talking? No, it's me.
Difficult to tell the difference these days.
Told you, I made a promise.
A vow.
All right.
I'll see what I can do.
But remember this, brother mine, agents like Mary tend not to reach retirement age.
They get retired in a pretty permanent sort of way.
Not on my watch.
MARY: 'My darling, I need to tell you this because you mustn't hate me for going away.
' NEW YORK ACCENT: Pardon me, I can hear a squeaking.
- Can you hear a squeaking? - No.
Only I watched a documentary on the Discovery Channel.
Why Planes Fail.
- Did you see it? Oh, truly terrifying.
- Can't say I did.
Swore I would never fly again, yet hear I am! Everything OK, madam? No.
No, no, it's not, but then what's the use in complaining? I hear a squeaking.
Probably the wing will come off is all.
Everything's fine, I promise you.
Just relax.
Oh, OK.
Relax.
She said relax.
[CHUCKLES] Did you have a nice time in London? It was OK, I guess.
But did somebody hide the sun? - Did you lose it in the war? - [SHE LAUGHS] 'I gave myself permission to have an ordinary life.
I'm not running, I promise you that, I just need to do this in my own way.
' Oh, God! I'm I-I don't feel so good.
Oh, my God! [FLIGHT ATTENDANT BUTTON BEEPS] - Everything OK, madam? - I think I'm dying.
I don't feel so good.
You're all right.
Oh, you're sweet.
You have a very kind face.
God will smile on you.
'But I don't want you and Sherlock hanging off my gun arm, I'm sorry, my love.
' I know you'll try to find me but there is no point.
Every move is random and not even Sherlock Holmes can anticipate the roll of a dice.
I need to move the target far, far away from you and Rosie, and then I'll come back, my darling.
I swear I will.
' [LAUGHTER] Not like this one.
You haven't got a chance, not a chance.
I've got you where I want you.
Give in, give in! I will destroy you.
You're completely at my mercy.
Mr Baker.
Well, that completes the set.
- No, it does not.
- Well, who else am I missing? Master Bun, it's not a set without him.
How many more times, Mr Sherlock? Hmm, maybe it's because I'm not familiar with the concept.
Oh, hi, Mary.
What concept? Happy families.
Nice trip? - How the f? - Please, Mary, there is a child present.
- How did you get in here? - Karim let me in.
Hello.
Karim, would you be so kind as to fetch us some tea? - Sure.
- Thank you.
Nice to meet you, missus.
No, I mean how did you find me? I'm Sherlock Holmes.
No, really, though, how? Every movement I made was entirely random, every new personality just on the roll of a dice! Mary, no human action is ever truly random.
An advanced grasp of the mathematics of probability, mapped onto a thorough apprehension of human psychology and the known dispositions of any given individual, can reduce the number of variables considerably.
I myself know of at least 58 techniques to refine a seemingly infinite array of randomly generated possibilities down to the smallest number of feasible variables.
But they're really difficult, so instead I just stuck a tracer on the inside of the memory stick.
[HE CHUCKLES] JOKINGLY: Oh, you bastard! - ANGRILY: You bastard! - I know, but your face! "The mathematics of probability"? - You believed that.
- "Feasible variables"? Yes, I started to run out about then.
In the memory stick! Yeah, that was my idea.
- AGRA? - Yes.
Uh-huh.
You said it was your initials.
In a way that was true.
In a way? So many lies.
I'm so sorry.
And I don't just mean you.
What? Alex, Gabriel, Ajay You're R? Rosamund? Rosamund Mary.
I always liked Mary.
Yeah, me too.
I used to.
I just I didn't know what else to do.
You could have stayed, you could have talked to me.
That's what couples are supposed to do.
Work things through.
Yes.
Yes, of course.
Mary, I may not be a very good man but I think I'm a bit better than you give me credit for, - most of the time.
- All the time.
You're always a good man, John, I've never doubted that.
You never judge, you never complain.
I don't deserve you, I All I ever wanted to do was keep you and Rosie safe, that's all.
I will keep you safe.
But it has to be in London.
It's my city, I know the turf.
Come home and everything will be all right, I promise you.
Get down! [RAPID GUNFIRE] Hello again.
- Ajay? - Oh, you remember me, I'm touched.
Look, I thought you were dead, believe me, I did.
I've been looking forward to this for longer than you can imagine.
I swear to you, I thought you were dead.
I thought I was the only one who got out.
How did you find us? By following you, Sherlock Holmes.
I mean, you're clever.
You found her but I found you.
So perhaps not so clever.
And now here we are.
At last.
[HE CHUCKLES] Touche! Listen, whatever you think you know, we can talk about this, we can work it out.
She thought I was dead.
I might as well have been.
It was always just the four of us, always, remember? Oh, yeah.
So why do you want to kill me? Do you know how long they kept me prisoner? What they did to me? They tortured Alex to death.
I can still hear the sound of his back breaking.
But you? You, where were you? That day at the embassy, I escaped.
Ha! But I lost sight of you too, so you explain.
Where were you? Oh, I got out.
For a while.
Long enough to hide my memory stick.
I didn't want that to fall into their hands.
I was loyal, you see.
Loyal to my friends.
But they took me, tortured me.
Not for information.
Not for anything except fun.
They thought I'd give in, die, but I didn't, I lived.
And eventually, they forgot about me rotting in a cell somewhere.
Six years they kept me there.
Until one day I saw my chance.
Oh, and I made them pay.
You know, all the time I was there, I just kept picking up things.
Little whispers.
Laughter.
Gossip.
How the clever agents had been betrayed.
Brought down by you! - Me? - [TRAIN WHISTLES] You know I'll kill you too.
You know I will, Ajay.
What, you think I care if I die? I've dreamed of killing you every night for six years.
Of squeezing the life out of your treacherous, lying throat.
I swear to you, Ajay.
What did you hear, Ajay? When you were a prisoner, what exactly did you hear? What did I hear? Ammo.
Every day as they tore into me, "Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
Ammo.
" We were betrayed! - And they said it was her? - That you betrayed us! They said her name? Yeah, they said it was the English woman.
No! No! 'The English woman, that's all he heard.
Naturally, he assumed it was Mary.
' Couldn't this wait until you're back? No, it's not over.
Ajay said that they'd been betrayed, the hostage-takers knew AGRA were coming.
There was only a voice on the phone.
'Remember? And a codeword.
' "Ammo," yes, you said.
How's your Latin, brother dear? My Latin? Amo, amas, amat.
I love, you love, he loves.
What? Not "Ammo" as in ammunition, but "Amo", meaning? You'd better be right, Sherlock.
Bloody thing! What's going on? I'm very sorry, Lady Smallwood, your security protocols have been temporarily rescinded.
What? 'So many lies.
And I don't just mean you.
' - Hello.
- Ah, hello.
- I like your daisy.
- Thank you, yeah.
It's not really me, though, I think.
- No? - No, no, it's too floral for me.
I'm more of a "knackered with weary old eyes" kind of guy.
Well, I think they're nice.
Nice eyes.
- [HE LAUGHS] Thank you.
- Look Look I don't normally do this, - but, um - But you're going to.
Yeah.
- What's this? - This is me.
- Thank you.
Cheers.
- Yeah.
Great.
- Bye! - Bye.
[HE CHUCKLES] [PHONE BEEPS] Now, you think we'd have noticed, when she was born.
Hmm? Noticed what? The little 666 on her forehead.
Hmm, that's The Omen.
- So? - Well, you said it was like The Exorcist.
They're two different things.
She can't be the devil and the Antichrist.
[BABY CRIES] - Yeah, can't she? - Hmm.
I'm coming darling.
I'm coming.
[PHONE BEEPS] Oh, what are you doing? What are you doing? - - Come here It's OK.
- - Do you want a cuddle? [BABY CONTINUES TO WAIL] I know.
- Oh, sweetheart.
- Ssh.
Oh, you're not going to stop crying, are you? I know, shall we go and see Daddy? Oh, let's go and see Daddy! Daddy's here.
It's OK, Rosie.
I'll take her.
- Yeah? - Yeah, I may as well get up now.
Hey, baby, it's Daddy.
Your daddy.
Come here, Rose.
Come here, darling, it's all right.
Thank you.
This is absolutely ridiculous and you know it.
How many more times? Six years ago you held the brief for Foreign Operations, code name Love.
And you're basing all this on a code name? On a whispered voice on the telephone? Come on, Mycroft.
You were the conduit for AGRA.
Every assignment, every detail they got from you.
It was my job.
Then there was the Tbilisi incident.
AGRA went in.
- Yes.
- And they were betrayed.
Not by me.
Mycroft, we have known each other a long time.
I promise you, I haven't the foggiest idea what all this is about.
You wound up AGRA and all the other freelancers.
I haven't done any of the things you're accusing me of.
Not one.
Not.
One.
Do you think she'll like bedtime stories? I'd like to do those.
Yeah? Yeah.
I just make a series of gurgling noises at the moment.
Although she does seem to enjoy them.
Well, I'll have to give that a go.
Got a lot to catch up on.
AJAY: 'You think you understand.
You understand nothing.
' MYCROFT: 'Code names Antarctica, Langdale, Porlock and Love.
' MARY: 'You'd be amazed at what a receptionist picks up.
'They know everything.
' 'They said it was the English woman.
' 'Don't minute any of this.
' 'They know everything.
' - You don't make it easy, do you? - What do you mean? Well, being being so perfect.
Mary, I I need to tell you - [PHONE BEEPS] - Hang on.
Can you tell me later? - Yeah.
Yeah.
- Great.
Well, no, we can't just go.
- Rosie.
- Yeah.
- Er, you go.
- No! I'll come as soon as I've found someone.
Mrs Hudson.
- Corfu till Saturday.
Molly? - Er, yeah, I'll try.
Well, we should both stay and wait for her.
You know that's not going to happen.
If there's more to this case, you need to see it.
Yeah, OK, you win.
'Ladies and gentlemen, the aquarium will be closing in five minutes.
'Please make your way to the exit.
Thank you.
' Your office said I'd find you here.
This was always my favourite spot for agents to meet.
We're like them.
Ghostly, living in the shadows.
Predatory? Well, it depends which side you're on.
Also, we have to keep moving or we die.
Nice location for the final act, couldn't have chosen it better myself.
But then I never could resist a touch of the dramatic.
I just come here to look at the fish.
I knew this would happen one day.
- It's like that old story.
- I really am a very busy man.
Would you mind cutting to the chase? You're very sure of yourself, aren't you? With good reason.
"There was once a merchant, in a famous market in Baghdad.
" I really have never liked this story.
I'm just like the merchant in the story, I thought I could out-run the inevitable.
I've always been looking over my shoulder, always expecting to see the grim figure of Death.
- Hello, Mary.
- Hey.
- John? - On his way.
Let me introduce Ammo.
You were Ammo? You were the person on the phone that time? Using AGRA as her private assassination unit.
Why did you betray us? Why does anyone do anything? - Hmm.
- Let me guess, selling secrets? Well, it would be churlish to refuse.
Worked very well for a few years.
I bought a nice cottage in Cornwall on the back of it.
But The ambassador in Tbilisi found out.
I thought I'd had it.
Then she was taken hostage in that coup.
[SHE CHUCKLES] I couldn't believe my luck! That bought me a little time.
But then you found out your boss had sent AGRA in.
Very handy.
They were always such reliable killers.
What you didn't know, Mary, was that this one also tipped off the hostage-takers.
Lady Smallwood gave the order.
But I sent another one to the terrorists, with a nice little clue about her code name, should anyone have an enquiring mind.
Seemed to do the trick.
And you thought your troubles were over.
I was tired.
Tired of the mess of it all.
I just wanted some peace, some clarity.
The hostages were killed.
AGRA too.
Or so I thought.
My secret was safe.
But apparently not.
Just a little peace.
That's all you wanted too, wasn't it? A family? Home? Really, I understand.
So, just let me get out of here, right? Let me just walk away.
I'll vanish, I'll go forever.
What do you say? After what you did?! Mary, no! OK.
London Aquarium.
Yes, now.
I was never a field agent.
I always thought I'd be rather good.
[MARY SCOFFS] Well, you handled the operation in Tbilisi very well.
Thanks.
- For a secretary.
- What? It can't have been easy all those years, sitting in the back, keeping your mouth shut when you knew you were cleverer than most of the people in the room.
- I didn't do this out of jealousy.
- No? Same old drudge, day in, day out.
Never getting out there where all the excitement was.
Just back to your little flat on Wigmore Street.
They've taken up the pavement outside the post office there.
The local clay on your shoes is very distinctive.
Yes, your little flat.
- How do you know? - Well, on your salary, it would have to be modest, and you spent all the money on that cottage, didn't you? And what are you, widowed or divorced? Wedding ring is at least 30 years old and you've moved it to another finger.
That means you're sentimentally attached to it, but you're not still married.
I favour widowed, given the number of cats you share your life with.
- Sherlock - Two Burmese and a Tortoiseshell, judging by the cat hairs on your cardigan.
A divorcee is more likely to look for a new partner, a widow to fill the void left by her dead husband.
- Sherlock, don't.
- Pets do that, or so I'm told.
There's clearly no-one new in your life, or you wouldn't be spending your Friday nights in an aquarium.
That accounts for the drink problem too, the slight tremor in your hand, the red wine stain ghosting your top lip.
So, yes, I'd say jealousy was your motive after all.
To prove how good you are.
To make up for the inadequacies of your little life.
Well, Mrs Norbury, I must admit this is unexpected.
Vivian Norbury, who out-smarted them all.
All except Sherlock Holmes.
There's no way out.
So it would seem.
You've seen right through me, Mr Holmes.
It's what I do.
Maybe I can still surprise you.
Now, come on, be sensible.
Hmm, no, I don't think so.
Ah! Surprise! [MARY GASPS FOR AIR] [MARY GROANS] Everything's fine.
It's going to be OK.
Get an ambulance! It's all right, it's all right.
- Mary! - John.
All right, Mary? Mary? Stay with me, stay with me.
- Oh, come on - No, don't worry.
Come on, Doctor, you can do better than that.
Come on, Mary.
Mary? Oh, God.
John, I think this is it.
No, no, no, no.
It's not.
- That's - You made me so happy.
You gave me everything I could ever, ever have wanted Ssh, ssh, Mary, Mary, ssh, ssh.
- Look after Rosie.
- Ssh, ssh, ssh.
- Promise me.
- I promise.
- No - Yes, I promise.
- Promise me! - I promise, I promise.
Ssh, ssh.
Hey, Sherlock.
Yes.
I so like you.
Did I ever say? Yes, yes, you did.
I'm sorry for for shooting you that time.
I'm really sorry.
- It's all right.
- I think we're even now, OK? OK.
- Oh, I think we're - Mary, Mary - even, definitely even.
- Ssh, ssh.
You were my whole world.
Being Mary Watson was the only life worth living.
- Mary - Thank you.
Mary [HE BEWAILS] Don't you dare! You made a vow.
You swore it.
[PHONE BEEPS REPEATEDLY] 'You've been having dreams.
A recurring dream?' [CLOCK TICKS RHYTHMICALLY] Do you want to talk about it? This is a two-way relationship, you know.
[SHE SIGHS] The whole world has come crashing down around you.
Everything's hopeless.
Irretrievable.
I know that's what you must feel but I can only help you if you completely open yourself up to me.
That's not really my style.
I need to know what to do.
Do? About John.
[BACK CRACKS, HE GROANS] Put me through to Sherrinford, please.
Yes, I'll wait.
SOBS: But nothing will ever be the same again, will it? I'm afraid it won't.
We'll have to rally round, I expect, do our bit.
Look after little Rosie.
I'm just going to, um look through these things.
There might be a case.
A case? Oh, you're not up to it, are you? Work is the best antidote to sorrow, Mrs Hudson.
Yes.
Yes, I expect you're right.
I'll make some tea, shall I? - Mrs Hudson? - Yes, Sherlock? If you ever think I'm becoming a bit full of myself, cocky or over-confident - Yes? - would you just say the word Norbury to me? Would you? Norbury? Just that.
I'd be very grateful.
What's this? Oh, I brought that up.
It was mixed up with my things.
Oh, God! Is that? - Must be.
- Oh.
I knew it wouldn't end like this.
I knew Moriarty made plans.
'I thought that would get your attention.
So, this is in case In case the day comes.
If you are watching this, I'm probably dead.
I hope I can have an ordinary life but who knows? Nothing's certain, nothing's written.
My old life it was full of consequences.
The danger was the fun part but you can't outrun that forever.
You need to remember that.
So I'm giving you a case, Sherlock.
Might be the hardest case of your career.
When I'm gone, if I'm gone I need you to do something for me.
' - [BABY GURGLES] - Hi.
I just wondered how things were going and if there was anything I could do.
It's, er, it's from John.
- Right.
- You don't need to read it now.
I'm sorry, Sherlock.
He says John said if you were to come round asking after him, offering to help Yes? He said he'd that he'd rather have anyone but you.
Anyone.
[DOOR CLOSES] 'I'm giving you a case, Sherlock.
When I'm gone, if I'm gone I need you to do something for me.
Save John Watson.
Save him, Sherlock.
Save him.
' 'When does the path we walk on lock around our feet? When does the road become a river with only one destination?' 'Death waits for us all in Samarra.
But can Samarra be avoided?' Go to hell, Sherlock!
 Tell me about your morning.
Start from the beginning.
I woke up.
How did you sleep? I didn't.
I don't.
You just said you woke up.
I stopped lying down.
Alone? Of course alone.
I meant Rosie.
Your daughter.
- Er, she's with friends.
- Why? Can't always cope.
And, er, last night wasn't good.
That's understandable.
Is it? Why? Why is it understandable? Why does everything have to be understandable? Why can't some things be unacceptable and we just say that? I only mean it's OK.
I'm letting my daughter down, how the hell is that OK? You just lost your wife.
And Rosie just lost her mother.
You are holding yourself to an unreasonable standard.
No, I'm failing to.
So there is no-one you talk to? Confide in? No-one.
Oh, I'm picking up Rosie this afternoon, after I've seen my therapist.
Got a new one, seeing her today.
Are you going to tell her about me? No.
Why not? - Because I can't.
- Why not? Because I can't.
You know I can't.
She thinks you're dead.
John, you've got to remember, it's important.
I am dead.
Please, for your own sake and for Rosie's, this isn't real.
- I'm dead.
John, look at me.
- Hmm.
I'm not here.
You know that, don't you? OK, I'll see you later.
Is there anything you're not telling me? No.
What are you looking at? Nothing.
You keep glancing to my left.
Oh, I suppose I was just looking away.
There is a difference between looking away and looking to.
- I tend to notice these things.
- I'm sure.
Now, I am reminding you of your friend, I think.
That's not necessarily a good thing.
Do you talk to Sherlock Holmes? I haven't seen him.
No-one's seen him.
He's locked himself away in his flat.
God knows what he's up to.
Do you blame him? I don't blame I don't think about him.
Has he attempted to make contact with you? No.
How can you be sure? He might have tried.
No, if Sherlock Holmes wants to get in touch, that's not something you can fail to notice.
[CAR ENGINE ACCELERATES] [TYRES SQUEAL] [CLATTERING] [SIREN WAILS] Well, now, won't you introduce me? REPORTER: Mr Smith, will you say something about your property Hello.
Mr Smith? Whenever you are ready.
The charity fund Now, please.
Bring them through.
It's difficult, having such good friends.
Friends are people you want to share with.
Friends and family.
What's the very worst thing you can do to your very best friends? Something on your mind? Yes, Ivan.
Oh, yes.
Whatever you tell us stays in this room.
I think I speak for everyone.
[MURMURS OF ASSENT] Well, what is the worst thing you could do? Tell them your darkest secret.
Because if you tell them and they decide they'd rather not know, you can't take it back.
You can't unsay it.
Once you've opened your heart, you can't close it again.
[CULVERTON ROARS WITH LAUGHTER] I'm kidding! Of course you can.
Well, everyone, please roll up your right sleeves.
Roll up your right sleeves.
Come on.
Oh, it's, er It's a bit of insurance.
I don't understand.
What is that? TD 12.
One of ours.
One of yours? We make it.
My company, TD 12.
Sells mainly to dentists and hospitals, for minor surgical procedures.
Interferes with with the memory.
The memory.
Yes.
I want to thank you, Ivan, for allowing me to use it.
I didn't exactly know who you were going to be using it on.
You mean you didn't ask? Is everyone ready? - No.
- Please, roll up your sleeves.
Come on, roll up.
This is obscene.
All I'm doing, Faith, dear is getting something off my chest, without getting it on yours.
What you're about to hear me say may horrify you, but you will forget it.
If you think about it, civilisation has always depended on a measure of elective ignorance.
[HE CHUCKLES] These drip feeds will keep the drug in your bloodstreams at exactly the right levels.
Nothing that is happening to you now will stay with you for more than a few minutes.
I'm afraid that some of the memories you've had up to this point might also be corrupted.
I'm going to share something with you now, something personal and of importance to me.
I have a need to confess, but you, I think, might have a need to forget.
By the end of this, you'll be free to go, and don't worry, by the time you're back in the outside world, you will not remember any of what you've heard.
Ignorance is bliss.
Well, what's wrong with bliss? [DISTORTED TONE] Some of you know each other and some of you don't.
Please, be aware that one of you is a high-ranking police officer.
One of you is a member of the judiciary.
One of you sits on the board of a prominent broadcaster.
Two of you work for me.
And one of you, of course, is my lovely daughter, Faith.
You are the people I need to hear me.
I have made millions.
For myself, for the people round this table, for millions of people I've never even met.
[REPORTERS CLAMOUR] There are charities that I support who wouldn't exist without me.
If life is a balance sheet, and I think it is, why, I believe I'm in credit! But I have a situation that needs to be managed.
I have a problem and there is only one way that I can solve it.
And what's that? I'm terribly sorry.
I need to kill someone.
Who? Were we in a meeting? Was there a meeting? Need to kill someone.
Faith - My dear, dear girl.
- I can't remember.
Can't remember who you were going to kill.
Dear, in five minutes, you won't even remember why you were crying.
The others are all fine.
You know they've gone down the pub.
It's all on me! [FAITH CRIES] Oh, Faith, don't you think I should take that? It's only going to upset you.
Hmm? Three years ago, my father told me he wanted to kill someone.
One word, Mr Holmes, and it changed my world forever.
Just one word.
What word? A name.
What name? I can't remember.
I can't remember who my father wanted to kill.
- And I don't know if he ever did it.
- Well, you've changed, you no longer top up your tan and your roots are showing.
Letting yourself go? Do you ever look in the mirror and want to see someone else? - No, do you own an American car? - I'm sorry? No, not American, left-hand drive, that's what I mean.
No.
Why do you ask? Not sure, actually, probably just noticed something.
Are you OK? Oh, of course you don't own a car, you don't need one, do you, living in isolation, no human contact, no visitors.
- OK, how do you know that? - Well, it's all here, isn't it? Look.
Cost-cutting is clearly a priority for you, look at the size of your kitchen, teeny tiny.
Must be a bit annoying when you're such a keen cook.
- I don't understand - Hang on a minute, I was looking out of the window, why was I doing that? - I don't know.
- Me neither.
Must have had a reason.
It'll come back to me.
Presumably you downsized when you when you left your job and maybe when you ended your relationship.
- You can't know that.
- Course I can.
There wasn't anything physical going on, was there? For quite some time, in fact.
There, see? It's obvious.
You can't tell things like that from a piece of paper.
I think I just did, didn't I? I'm sure that was me.
How? Don't know.
Just sort of happens really.
It's like a reflex, I can't stop it.
Coat.
I don't have a coat.
Yes, what I just noticed.
I wonder why.
Who are you talking to? Piss off! So what do you think? - Of what? - My case.
Oh, it's way too weird for me.
Go to the police, they're really excellent at dealing with this complicated sort of stuff.
Tell them I sent you, that ought to get a reaction.
Night-night.
[SLOWED-DOWN WHOOSH] Please I have no-one else to turn to.
Yes, well, I'm very busy at the moment, I have to drink a cup of tea.
Is "cup of tea"code? It's a cup of tea.
Because you might prefer some "coffee".
You're my last hope.
Really? That's bad luck, isn't it? Goodnight, go away.
What's bad luck? Stop talking, it makes me aware of your existence.
I've always had bad luck.
It's congenital.
Handbag! That's not rude.
Congenital.
It just means Handbag! Stop! Wait! Your life is not your own! Keep your hands off it, do you hear me? Off it.
Off it.
Sorry? What? What are you talking about? - Your skirt.
- My skirt? Look at the hem of it, that's what I noticed.
Sorry, I'm still catching up with my brain.
It's terribly fast.
Those markings, you see them? You only get marks like that by trapping the hem of your skirt in a car door, but they're on the left-hand side, so you weren't driving, you were in the passenger seat.
I came in a taxi.
There is no taxi waiting in the street outside, that's what I checked when I went to the window.
And you've got all the way to the door and not made any move to phone for one.
And look at you.
You didn't even bring a coat, in this rain? Now, all that might mean nothing, except with the angle of the scars on your left forearm, you know, under that sleeve you keep pulling down.
You never saw them.
No, I didn't, so thank you for confirming my hypothesis.
I don't really need to check that the angle is consistent - with self-harm, do I? - No.
Then you can keep your scars.
I want to see your handbag.
Why? It's too heavy.
You said I was your last hope and now you are going out into the night with no plan on how you're getting home and a gun.
- Chips.
- Chips? You're suicidal, you're allowed chips.
Trust me, it's about the only perk.
Sherlock? Are you going out? I think I remember the way, it's through there, isn't it? But you're in no state, look at you! Yeah, well, I've got a friend with me, so What friend? Bye.
Oh! Come on.
I'm Culverton Smith, and this election year, I'll be voting For God's sake! I was talking to the Prime Minister.
I'm sorry, Mr Holmes, it's your brother.
He's left his flat.
Was it on fire? [SIZZLING] 'Even when I'm on the road, I still like quality food.
' You see the fold in the middle? For the first few months you kept this hidden, folded inside a book.
It must have been a tightly packed shelf, going by the severity of the crease.
So obviously you were keeping it hidden from someone living in the same house at a level of intimacy where privacy could not be assumed.
Conclusion, relationship.
Not any more, though.
There's a pinprick at the top of the paper.
For the past few months it's been on open display on a wall.
Conclusion? Relationship is over.
The paper's been exposed to steam in a variety of cooking smells, so it must have been on display in the kitchen.
A lot of different spices, you're suicidal, alone and strapped for cash, yet you're still cooking to impress.
You're keen, then.
The kitchen is the most public room in any house.
And since any visitor could be expected to ask about a note like this, I have to assume you don't have any.
You've isolated yourself.
Amazing.
I know.
I meant the chips.
Hmm.
[HELICOPTER WHIRS] Let's go for a walk.
[PHONE BUZZES] - You should answer it.
- It's Mycroft.
Might be about Sherlock.
Of course it's about Sherlock.
Everything's about Sherlock.
'How did you know my kitchen was tiny?' Well, look, the fading pattern on the paper, it's not much, but it's enough to know your kitchen window faces east.
Now, kitchen noticeboards.
By instinct, you place them at eye level, where there's natural light.
Now look, the sun's only struck the bottom two thirds, but the line is straight, so that means we know the paper is facing the window.
But, because the top section is unaffected, we know the sunlight can only be entering the room at a steep angle.
If the sunlight was able to penetrate the room when the sun was lower in the sky, then the paper would be equally faded, top to bottom.
But no.
It only makes it when the sun is at its zenith, so I'm betting that you live in a narrow street on the ground floor.
Now, if steeply angled sunlight manages to hit eye level on the wall opposite the window, then what do we know about the room? The room's small.
[HELICOPTER WHIRS] Oh, Big Brother is watching you! Literally.
We can keep tabs.
You didn't have to come in.
I was talking to the Prime Minister.
Oh, I see.
What's he doing? Why is he just wandering about like a fool? She died, Mycroft.
He's probably still in shock.
Everybody dies.
It's the one thing human beings can be relied upon to do.
How can it still come as a surprise to people? You sound cross.
Am I going to be taken away by security again? I have, I think, apologised extensively.
You haven't made it up to me.
And how am I supposed to do that? - Sex.
- I'm sorry? Sex.
How did you know I wasn't getting any? It's all about the blood.
This one comes from the very first night.
You can see the pen marks over it.
I think you discovered that pain stimulated your memory, so you tried it again later.
I'm no expert, but I assume that since your lover failed to notice an increasing number of scars over a period of months, that the relationship was no longer intimate.
How do you know he didn't notice? Oh, well, cos he would have done something about it.
Would he? - Wouldn't he? - Isn't that what you people do? - Well, that's interesting.
- What is? The way you think.
- Superbly? - Sweetly.
I'm not sweet, I'm just high.
This way.
- Well, we just came that way.
- I know, it's a plan.
What plan? What is it? What What now? Sorry, um, traced his route on the map.
[HE SIGHS] Is he with someone? Not sure.
We keep losing visual.
Mostly we're tracking his phone.
Don't call us, we'll call I'm trying to sleep, can you stop ringing my damn phone? 'Sherlock has left his flat, first time in a week.
' - So I'm having him tracked.
- 'Nice.
' It's very touching how you can hijack the machinery of the state to look after your own family.
Can I go to sleep now? Sherlock gone rogue is a legitimate security concern.
The fact that I'm his brother changes absolutely nothing.
It didn't the last time, and I assure you, it won't with with Sherlock.
Sorry, what? 'Please phone me if he gets in contact, thank you.
' Do you still speak to Sherrinford? I get regular updates.
And? Sherrinford is secure.
Are we going to walk all night? Possibly.
It's a long word.
What is? "Bollocks".
Culverton Smith, all this charity work, what's in it for you? We must be careful not to burn our bridges.
Do you know why I'm going to take your case? Because of the one impossible thing you said.
What impossible thing? You said your life turned on one word.
Yes.
The name of the person my father wanted to kill.
That's the impossible thing.
Just that, right there.
What's impossible? Names are not one word.
They're always at least two.
Sherlock Holmes.
Faith Smith.
Santa Claus.
Winston Churchill.
Napoleon Bonaparte Actually, just Napoleon would do.
Or Elvis.
Well, I think we can rule both of them out as targets.
OK, I got it wrong, then.
It wasn't on one word, it can't have been.
And you remember quite distinctly that your whole life turned on one word.
So that happened, I don't doubt it, but how can that word be a name? A name you instantly recognised that tore your world apart? - OK, well, how? - No idea yet.
But I don't work for free.
- You take cash? - Not cash, no.
Taking your own life.
Interesting expression, taking it from who? Once it's over, it's not you who'll miss it.
[GUNSHOT] Your own death is something that happens to everybody else.
Your life is not your own.
Keep your hands off it.
You're not what I expected, you [HE GROANS] - What? What am I? - Nicer.
Than who? - Anyone.
- [HE WAILS] CHILD SINGS: My little master Who will find me Sorry, I Faith? Faith? ECHOING: 'You said your life turned on one word.
A name can't be one word.
If you were to come round asking after him 'that he'd rather have anyone but you.
Anyone.
You're not what I expected.
- What? What am I? - Nicer.
- Than who? - Anyone.
Don't think anyone else is going to save him, because there isn't anyone.
' - Anyone.
Anyone.
Anyone.
- Anyone.
Anyone.
Anyone.
' I have a situation that needs to be managed.
There's only one way that I can solve it.
And what's that? I need to kill someone.
Who? Who? Anyone! Of course! He doesn't want to kill one person, he wants to kill anyone.
He's a serial killer.
Anyone.
- He could be! - Anyone! Why not? Why shouldn't he be? - [HORNS BEEP] - Oi, you! What's the matter with you?! 'Anyone!' Do you know where you are? Are you drunk? Shezzer.
What are you doing here? What were you doing in the middle of a bloody street? You should be at Baker Street.
I am.
So are you.
They found your address, they brought you here.
You've had too much.
And that's me saying that! Kill.
Kill.
- Anyone.
- Anyone.
They're always poor and lonely and strange.
But those are only the ones we catch.
Who do we catch? Serial killers.
What if you were rich and powerful and necessary? Anyone.
What if you had the compulsion to kill and money? What then?! [MUSIC: Symphony No.
9 (Ode To Joy) by Beethoven] [SIREN WAILS] [MUSIC INTENSIFIES] Well, now, won't you introduce me? [SHE SIGHS] Right, you there! Stop right where you are! - What? Oh, John - Mrs Hudson Do you have any idea what speed you were going at? No, of course not! I was on the phone.
- Oh, it's for you, by the way.
- For me? - It's the Government.
- The what? - What's going on? What's wrong? - Hello? - Look at the state of you - 'My name is Mycroft Holmes.
I am speaking to you from the Cabinet Office.
' - What's happened? - It's Sherlock! You've no idea what I've been through! Argh! Right! Argh! - Away! - [CLATTERING] - I'm out of here! He's lost it.
- Where is it?! - He's totally gone! - Aah! Once more unto the breach, dear friends! Once more! Or close the wall up with our English dead! Set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide! Hold hard the breath and build up every spirit to his full height! On! On, you noblest English whose blood is fet from fathers of war-proof! And you, good yeoman, Whose limbs were made in England, show us here the mettle of your pasture.
Which I doubt not for there is none of you here so mean and base that hath not noble lustre in your eyes! I see you standing like greyhounds in the slips, straining upon the start! The game's afoot.
Oh, hello.
Can I have a cup of tea? Did you call the police? Of course I didn't call the police, I'm not a civilian! These pictures, they're that man on the telly, aren't they? - What pictures? - They're everywhere.
Oh, these pictures?! Oh, you can see them too? That's good.
Culverton Smith.
This, I think, is relevant, from this morning.
He's publicly accused Mr Smith of being a serial killer.
Christ! Sherlock on Twitter, he really has lost it.
Don't you dare make jokes! Don't you dare! I was terrified! Cup of tea! Oh, for goodness' sakes! What's the matter with you?! Are you having an earthquake?! You need to see him, John, you need to help him! - No.
- He needs you! Somebody else! Not me, not now.
Now, you just listen to me, for once in your stupid life! I know Mary's dead and I know your heart is broken, but if Sherlock Holmes dies too, who will you have then? Because I'll tell you something, John Watson, you will not have me! [MRS HUDSON CRIES] Have you spoken to Mycroft? Molly? Anyone? They don't matter, you do.
Would you just see him? Please, John.
Or just take a look at him as a doctor.
I know you'd change your mind if you did.
Yeah, look, OK, maybe, if I get a chance.
Do you promise? I'll try, if I'm in the area.
Promise me? - I promise.
- Thank you.
Well, on you go.
Examine him.
Right then, mister! Now, I need your handcuffs.
I happen to know there's a pair in the salad drawer.
I've borrowed them before.
Oh, get over yourself! You're not my first smackhead, Sherlock Holmes! Woman's out of control! I asked for a cup of tea! - How did you get him in the boot? - The boys from the cafe.
They dropped me! Twice! And do you know why they dropped you, dear? Because they know you.
Who's this one? Is this a new person? - I'm against new people.
- Excuse me for a moment.
She's my therapist.
Awesome! Do you do block bookings? - Whose car is that? - That's my car.
How can that be your car?! Oh, for God's sake! I'm the widow of a drug dealer, I own property in central London, and for the last bloody time, John, I'm not your housekeeper! I'm so sorry, I answered your phone, you were busy.
I think you'll want to take it.
Yes, hello? Is this Dr John Watson? Yeah, who's this? Culverton Smith.
You've probably heard of me.
Um, well, yes.
Get me a fresh glass of water, please, this one's filthy.
'I mean, I'm aware of this morning's developments.
' Yes, I'm sure he was being hilarious.
Sorry, did you say "all still meeting"? 'You, me and Mr Holmes.
' I've sent a car, should be outside.
Mr Holmes gave me an address.
Well, he couldn't have given you this one [DOORBELL RINGS] When you're ready.
When did Sherlock give you this address? - Two weeks ago.
- Two weeks? 'Yes, two weeks.
' [PHONE CALL ENDS] How did you know where to find me? Oh, Sherlock told me.
He's not so difficult when you've got a gun on him.
How did you know?! How? On Monday, I decided to get a new therapist.
Tuesday afternoon, I chose her.
Wednesday morning, I booked today's session.
Now, today is Friday.
So two weeks ago, two weeks before you were abducted at gunpoint and brought here against your will, over a week before I even thought of coming here, you knew exactly where you'd need to be picked up for lunch?! Really? I correctly anticipated the responses of people I know well to scenarios I devised.
- Can't everyone do that? - How? Except the boot.
The boot was mean! Never mind how, he's dying to tell us that.
I want to know why? Because Mrs Hudson's right.
I'm burning up.
I'm at the bottom of a pit and I'm still falling, and I'm never climbing out.
I need you to know, John.
I need you to see that up here, I've still got it.
So, when I tell you that this is the most dangerous, the most despicable human being that I have ever encountered, when I tell you that this, this monster must be ended, please remember where you are standing, because you're standing exactly where I said you would be two weeks ago.
I'm a mess, I'm in hell, but I am not wrong, not about him.
So, what has all this got to do with me? That creature, that rotting thing is a living, breathing coagulation of human evil.
And if the only thing I ever do in this world is drive him out of it, then my life will not have been wasted.
Look at me! Can't do it, not now.
Not alone.
All right.
Yeah, well, they're real enough, I suppose.
- Why would I be faking? - Because you're a liar! You lie all the time, it's like your mission! I have been many things, John, but when have I ever been a malingerer?! You pretended to be dead for two years! Apart from that! Listen, before I do anything, I need to know what state you're in.
Well, you're a doctor, examine me.
No, I need a second opinion.
Oh, John, calm down.
When have you ever managed two opinions? You'd fall over.
I need the one person who, unlike me, learned to see through your bullshit long ago.
Who's that, then? I'm sure I would have noticed.
The last person you'd think of.
I want you to be examined by Molly Hooper.
Do you hear me? I said Molly Hooper.
You're really not going to like this.
- Like what? - [DOORBELL RINGS] Um, hello.
Is, er I'm sorry, Sherlock asked me to come.
- What, two weeks ago? - Yeah, about two weeks.
If you'd like to know how I predict the future - No, I don't care how! - OK, a fully equipped ambulance, Molly can examine me on the way, it'll save time.
- Ready to go, Molly? - Um, well Just tell me when to cough.
I hope you remembered my coat.
I'm sorry, I didn't know that you were going to be here.
Absolutely no idea what's going on.
Sherlock's using again.
Oh, God! Um, are are you sure? No, it's Sherlock, of course I'm not sure! Check him out.
Is Molly the right person to be doing medicals? She's more used to dead people.
It's bound to lower your standards.
I don't know.
Yeah, I don't know anything any more.
- Mrs Hudson, as ever, you are amazing.
- No.
You're going to have to buck up a bit, John, you know that, don't you? The game is on.
I'll do my best.
Anything you need, any time, just ask, anything at all.
Thank you.
Er, sometimes, can I borrow your car? No.
OK.
He knew you'd get a new therapist after I died, because you'd need to change everything.
That's just what you're like.
Thanks.
You keep your weekends for Rosie, so you needed to see someone during working hours.
Because you're an idiot, you don't want anyone at the surgery knowing you're in therapy, so that restricts you to lunchtime sessions, with someone reasonably close.
You found four men and one woman.
And you are done with the world being explained to you by a man.
Well, who isn't? So all he needed to do was find the first available lunchtime appointment with a female therapist within cycling distance of your surgery.
My God, he knows you! No, he doesn't.
I'm in your head, John.
You're disagreeing with yourself.
Are you ready, sir? Yes, I am.
He is the cleverest man in the world, but he's not a monster.
- Yeah, he is.
- Yeah, OK, all right, he is.
Agh! But he's our monster.
I'm a killer.
You know I'm a killer.
But did you know I'm a s - [LIGHT BULB EXPLODES] - Cut there! What was that? Was that a light? Er, was that me? Was I too good? - Huh? - He's here.
Well, how is he? Basically fine.
I've seen healthier people on the slab.
Yeah, but to be fair, you work with murder victims.
They tend to be quite young.
Not funny.
- A little bit funny.
- If you keep taking what you're taking at the rate you're taking it, you've got weeks.
Exactly, weeks! Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
For Christ's sake, Sherlock, it's not a game! I'm worried about you, Molly, you seem very stressed.
- I'm stressed, you're dying! - Yeah, well, I'm ahead, then.
Stress can ruin every day of your life.
Dying can only ruin one.
So this is real? You've really lost it? - You're actually out of control? - When have I ever been that? - Since the day I met you.
- Oh, clever boy.
I've missed you bumbling round the place.
- I thought this was some kind of - What? Trick.
This is not a trick, it's a plan.
Mr Holmes! 30 feet and closing, the most significant undetected serial killer in British criminal history.
Help me bring him down.
What? What plan? I'm not telling you.
- Why not? - Because you won't like it.
Mr Holmes.
I don't do handshakes.
It'll have to be a hug.
I know.
Oh, Sherlock.
Oh, Sherlock, what can I say? Thanks to you, we're, er we're everywhere! Mr Holmes, how did Culverton talk you into this? Well, he's a detective.
Maybe I just confessed.
[THEY LAUGH] Come on.
Now, it's a it's a new kind of breakfast cereal.
Mr Holmes, could you put on the hat? Yeah, he doesn't really wear the hat.
Kids will be getting two of their five-a-day before they've even left home.
Sherlock's been amazing for us.
Breakfast has got to be cool.
We're beyond viral.
And you know what makes it cool when you're a kid? What, sorry, beyond what? Dangerous! And action! I'm a killer.
You know I'm a killer.
But did you know I'm a cereal killer? Mmm! And cut there, thank you.
We should bag that up, sell it.
Make money for that on eBay.
You can make more if you want, any time you like.
Has it occurred to you, anywhere in your drug-addled brain, - that you've just been played? - Oh, yes.
For an ad campaign.
- Brilliant, isn't it? - Brilliant? The safest place to hide.
Plain sight.
Mr Holmes? Culverton wants to know if you're OK going straight to the hospital? Hospital? Culverton's doing a visit.
The kids would love to meet you both.
I think he sort of promised.
Oh, OK.
If you'd just like to come this way.
So, what are we doing here? What's the point? I needed a hug.
What do you think, Mr Holmes? Cereal killer? It's funny cos it's true! See you at the hospital.
Oh, you can have this back now.
- Have what back? - Thanks for the hug.
Oh, I sent and deleted a text.
You might get a reply, but I doubt it.
- It's password protected.
- Oh, please! [CULVERTON CHUCKLES] We're going to have endless fun, Mr Holmes, aren't we? Oh, no.
No, not endless.
Need another hit, do you? I can wait until the hospital.
Are you involved much? Sorry? Um, with Mr Holmes, Sherlock, in all his cases? Er, yeah, I'm John Watson.
OK.
Dr Watson.
I love his blog, don't you? His blog? - Why, don't you read it? - You mean my blog.
Say what you like about addiction, the day is full of highlights! - Oh, Mr Holmes, you're feeling better? - Psychedelic! I was just saying, I love your blog.
- Great, thanks.
- It's my blog.
It is, he writes the blog.
- It's yours? - Yes.
You write Sherlock's blog? Yes.
It's gone downhill a bit, hasn't it? It's this way, then.
- Oh, my God, I love your blog.
- You're welcome.
Right, here he comes, the internet tec.
You all know Sherlock Holmes.
Oh, and Dr Watson, of course.
Mr Holmes, I was wondering, well, we all were, weren't we, maybe you could tell us about some of your cases? No.
Yes.
Yes.
Absolutely, yes.
The main feature of interest in the field of criminal investigation is not the sensational aspects of the crime itself, but rather the iron chain of reasoning, from cause to effect, that reveals, step by step, the solution.
That's the only truly remarkable aspect of the entire affair.
Now, I will share with you the facts and evidence as they were available to me, and in this very room, you will all attempt to solve the case of Blessington The Poisoner.
I think you slightly gave away the ending.
There were five main suspects.
One of them called Blessington.
But it's more about how he did it.
- Poison? - OK.
[CHILDREN LAUGH] Drearcliff House, remember that one, John? One murder, ten suspects.
- Ten, yeah.
- All of them - guilty.
- Sherlock.
Now, what did you call that one, John? Um, something to do with murder at the zoo.
Yeah, I called it Murder At The Zoo.
Or was it the case of The Killer Orang-utan? You should be wearing the hat.
The kids would love the hat.
So, any more questions? No.
I don't think so.
No? Mr Holmes? Good, then I'll How do you catch a serial killer? Same way you catch any other killer.
No.
Most killers kill someone they know.
You're looking for a murderer in a tiny social grouping.
Um, Mr Smith, I'm just wondering, maybe this isn't a suitable subject for the children.
Nurse Cornish, how long have you been with us now? Seven years.
Seven years.
OK.
Serial killers choose their victims at random.
Surely that must make it more difficult.
Some of them advertise.
Do they really? Serial killing is an expression of power, ego, a signature in human destruction.
Ultimately, for full satisfaction, it requires plain sight.
Additionally, serial killers are easily profiled.
They tend to be social outcasts, educationally subnormal.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
You're just talking about the ones you know.
The ones you've caught.
But hello, dummy, you only catch the dumb ones.
Now, imagine if the Queen wanted to kill some people, what would happen then? All that power, all that money, sweet little government, dancing attendants.
A whole country just to keep her warm and fat.
Hmm.
We all love the Queen, don't we? And I bet she'd love you lot.
It's all right, everyone, I can personally assure you that Sherlock Holmes is not about to arrest the Queen.
Well, of course not.
Not Her Majesty.
Money, power, fame, some hings make you untouchable.
God save the Queen! She could open a slaughterhouse and we'd all probably pay the entrance fee.
- No-one's untouchable.
- No-one? Look at you all, so gloomy.
Can't you take a joke? The Queen! If the Queen was a serial killer, I'd be the first person she'd tell.
We have that kind of friendship.
A big round of applause for Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson.
Come on.
Wonderful.
Thank you so much for coming.
Thank you.
Where are we going now? I want to show you my favourite room.
No, let's go in here.
So you've had another one of your little meetings? Oh, it's just a monthly top-up.
Confession is good for the soul, providing you can delete it.
What's TD 12? It's a memory inhibitor.
Bliss.
Bliss? Opt-in ignorance.
It makes the world go round.
Anyone ever opt to remember? Some people take the drip out, yes.
Some people have the same urges.
Now, come on, wasting time.
Indeed, you have, I estimate, 20 minutes left.
Sorry? I sent a text from your phone, remember? It was read almost immediately.
Factoring in a degree of shock and emotional decision, and a journey time based on the associated address, I'd say that your life, as you know it, has 20 minutes left to run.
Well, no, 17 to be precise, but I rounded up for dramatic effect.
So, please do show us your favourite room.
It'll give you a chance to say goodbye.
[CULVERTON CHUCKLES] Come along.
The game is on.
Do you still miss me? Speaking of serial killers, you know who's my favourite? Other than yourself? HH Holmes.
Relative of yours? Not as far as I know.
You should check.
What an idiot.
Everyone out.
Mr Smith, we're actually in the middle of something.
Saheed, isn't it? Saheed, yes.
How long have you been working here now? - Four years.
- Four years.
Well, that's a long time, isn't it? Four years! OK, everyone.
Five minutes? Come back in ten.
Saheed this time, knock.
How can you do that? I mean, how are you even allowed in here? Oh, I can go anywhere I like.
Anywhere at all.
They gave you keys? They presented them to me.
There was a ceremony.
You can watch that on YouTube.
Home Secretary was there.
So, your favourite room, the mortuary? What do you think? Tough crowd.
Oh, I don't know.
I've always found them quite pliable.
- Don't do that! - She's fine.
She's dead.
HH Holmes loved the dead.
He mass-produced them.
Serial killer, active during the Chicago Fair.
Do you know what he did? He built a hotel, a special hotel just to kill people.
You know, with a hanging room, gas chamber, specially adapted furnace.
You know, like Sweeney Todd "Without the pies!" Stupid.
So stupid.
Why stupid? Well, all that effort.
You don't build a beach if you want to hide a pebble.
You just find a beach.
And if you want to hide a murder, if you want to hide lots and lots of murders, just find a hospital.
Can we be clear? Are you confessing? To what? The way you're talking Oh, sorry, yes.
You mean, am I a serial killer? Or am I just trying to mess with your funny little head? Well, it's true.
I do like to mess with people, and, yes, I am a bit creepy.
But that's just my USP.
I use it to sell breakfast cereal.
But am I what he says I am? Is that what you're asking? Yes.
Hmm.
Well, let me ask you this are you really a doctor? Yeah, of course I am.
Oh, no, a medical doctor? You know, not just feet or media studies or something? I'm a doctor.
Are you serious? No, really, are you? Are you are you actually serious? I've played along with this joke, it's not funny any more.
Look at him! Go ahead, look at him, Dr Watson! Oh, no, I'll lay it out for you.
There are two possible explanations for what's going on here.
Either I'm a serial killer, or Sherlock Holmes is off his tits on drugs! Hmm? Delusional paranoia about a public personality.
That's not so special, it's not even new.
I think you need to tell your faithful little friend how you're wasting his time, because you're too high to know what's real any more.
I apologise.
I I've miscalculated.
I forgot to factor in the traffic.
19 minutes.
[LIFT STOPS] Ah, the footsteps you're about to hear will be very familiar to you, not least because there'll be three impacts rather than two.
The third, of course, will be the end of a walking cane.
[LIFT PINGS] Your daughter Faith's walking cane.
And why would she be here? You invited her.
You sent her a text.
Or technically, I sent her a text, but she's not to know.
Now, let's see if I can recall.
"Faith, I can stand it no longer, I've confessed to my crimes.
"Please forgive me.
" Why would that have any effect? You don't know her.
Oh, but I do.
I spent a whole evening with her.
We had chips.
I think she liked me.
You don't know Faith.
You simply do not.
I know you care about her deeply.
I know you invited her to one of your special board meetings.
You care what she thinks.
You maintain an impressive facade.
I think it's about to break.
Did you know? She came to Baker Street.
No, she didn't.
Of course I didn't.
She came to see me, because she was scared of her daddy.
Never happened.
Is this another one of your drug-fuelled fantasies? - You didn't see him take the scalpel? - Nobody saw him.
So you didn't know what was about to happen? Of course I didn't know.
Well, let's see, shall we? Faith, stop loitering at the door and come in.
This is your father's favourite room! Come and meet his best friends.
Dad? What's happening? What was that text? Are you having one of your jokes? Who are you? Who the hell are you?! It's Sherlock Holmes, surely you recognise him? Oh, my God! Sherlock Holmes! I love your blog.
You're not her, you're not the woman who came to Baker Street.
Um, well, no.
Never been there.
Well, there must have been some build-up, he didn't just suddenly do it.
Look, I didn't know he had the bloody scalpel! Sorry, I'm not sure I completely understand.
Understand what? Well, I thought you two were were old friends? No.
We've never met.
Oh, dear.
Oh! Have we? Sherlock? So, who came to my flat? Well, it wasn't me.
No! [HE LAUGHS] You look different.
I wasn't there.
'Who came to my flat?' I'm sorry, Mr Holmes, but I don't think I've ever been anywhere near your flat.
Oh, dear.
Oh, no! Who are you talking to? What friend? Anyone.
Oh, no.
Oh, no! [HE LAUGHS] 'Faith? Oh, God!' Oh, no.
Oh, no! [HE LAUGHS] Sherlock? Sherlock, are you all right? Sherlock, are you OK? - Watch him, he's got a knife.
- I've got a what? You've got a scalpel, you picked it up from that table! I saw you take it.
I certainly did not! Look behind his back! No I saw you take it! I saw you! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Sherlock, do you want to put that down? Oh, my God! Stop laughing at me.
- I'm not laughing.
- He's not laughing, Sherlock.
- Stop laughing at me! - Sherlock! Oh, Christ! I keep wondering if we should have seen it coming.
Not long ago he shot Charles Magnussen in the face, we did see it coming.
We always saw it coming.
But it was fun.
[KNOCK ON DOOR] Come in.
Sir, you probably want to see this.
ON LAPTOP: 'Harold Chorley reporting earlier today.
'Mr Smith stated he had no interest in bringing charges.
' 'I'm a fan of Sherlock Holmes, I'm a big fan.
'I don't really know what happened today.
To be honest, 'I don't think I'd be standing here now if it wasn't for Dr Watson.
' Stop laughing at me! Sherlock! [CLATTER] Stop it! Stop it now! NEWSREADER: 'Is it true he's being treated in your hospital?' 'It's not actually my hospital.
' Well, it is a little bit my hospital.
But I can promise you this, he is going to get the best of care.
I might even move him to my favourite room.
NEWSREADER: 'Culverton Smith, earlier today.
In Nottingham' He's right, you know, you probably saved his life.
What are you doing?! Wake up! I really hit him, Greg.
Hit him hard.
Is this a game? Is it just a bloody game? [HOLMES GROANS] Please! Please, please, please, no violence.
Thank you, Dr Watson.
But I don't think he's a danger any more.
Leave him be.
No, it's OK.
Let him do what he wants.
He's entitled.
I killed his wife.
Yes, you did.
Oh, hi.
[HE MOUTHS] Just in to say hello? No.
I'm just in to say goodbye.
I'm sure he'll pull through.
And yeah, he's made a terrible mess of himself, but he's awfully strong.
So, must look on the bright side.
Hm.
Well Parting gift.
Ah, that's nice.
A walking stick.
Yeah, it was mine, from a long time ago.
[PHONE RINGS] Hello? Ward 73.
Oh, er, Dr Watson? Hm? It's for you.
Oh.
Hello, Mycroft.
'There's a car downstairs.
' You know, he should definitely have worn the hat.
Still thinking about Sherlock? No.
You are.
You've got your disapproving face on.
Well, seeing as I'm inside your head, I think we can call that self-loathing.
Where is she? Where's Mrs Hudson? She'll be up in a moment.
What are you doing? Have you noticed the kitchen? It's practically a meth lab.
I'm trying to establish exactly what drove Sherlock off the rails.
Any ideas? Are these spooks? Are you using spooks now to look after your family? - Hang on, are they tidying? - Sherlock is a security concern.
The fact that I'm his brother changes nothing.
- Yeah, you've said that before.
- Ask him.
Why fixate on Culverton Smith? He's had his obsessions before, of course, but this goes a bit further than setting a man-trap for Father Christmas.
Do it.
Ask him.
Spending all night talking to a woman who wasn't even there.
Oh, shut up, you! - Mycroft, last time, when we were on the phone - No, no, no, no, stop.
I detest conversation in the past tense.
You said the fact that you were his brother made no difference.
It doesn't.
You said it didn't the last time, and it wouldn't with Sherlock.
So who was it the last time? Who were you talking about? Attaboy! Nobody.
I misspoke.
He's lying.
You're lying.
I assure you, I'm not.
He really is lying.
Sherlock's not your only brother.
There's another one, isn't there? - No - Jesus! A secret brother.
What is he, locked up in a tower, or something? Mycroft Holmes! What are all these dreadful people doing in my house?! Mrs Hudson, I apologise for the interruption.
As you know, my brother has embarked on a programme of self-destruction remarkable even by his standards, and I am endeavouring to find out what triggered it.
- And that's what you're all looking for? - Quite so.
What's on his mind? So to speak.
And you've had all this time? Time being something of which we don't have an infinite supply, so if we could be about our business.
[SHE GIGGLES] You you're so funny, you are! Mrs Hudson? He thinks you're clever, poor old Sherlock.
Always going on about you.
I mean, he knows you're an idiot, but that's OK, cos you're a lovely doctor.
But he has no idea what an idiot you are! Is this merely stream-of-consciousness abuse, or are you attempting to make a point? You want to know what's bothering Sherlock? Easiest thing in the world, anyone can do it.
I know his thought processes better than any other human being, so, please, try to understand.
He's not about thinking.
Not Sherlock.
- Of course he is.
- No, no.
He's more emotional, isn't he? Unsolved case, shoot the wall! Boom, boom! Unmade breakfast, karate the fridge.
Unanswered question Well, what does he do with anything he can't answer, John? Every time? He stabs it.
Anything he can't find the answer for, bang! It's up there.
I keep telling him, if he was any good as a detective, I wouldn't need a new mantel! MARY: 'If you're watching this, I'm probably dead.
' OK, no.
Stop that now, please.
Everybody out, now! All of you! This is my house, this is my friend, and that's his departed wife.
Anyone who stays here a minute longer is admitting to me personally they do not have a single spark of human decency.
Get out of my house, you reptile! You've been ages waking up.
I watched you.
It was quite lovely, in its way.
Take it easy, it's OK.
Don't want to rush this.
You're Sherlock Holmes.
'I'm giving you a case, Sherlock.
Might be the hardest case of your career.
When I'm gone, if I'm gone, I need you to do something for me.
Save John Watson.
Save him, Sherlock.
' John, if you want to watch this later 'Save him.
Don't think anyone else is going to save him, because there isn't anyone.
It's up to you.
Save him.
But I do think you're going to need a little bit of help with that, because you're not exactly good with people, so here's a few things you need to know about the man we both love.
And more importantly, what you're going to need to do to save him.
' How did you get in? Policeman outside, you mean? Come on, can't you guess? Secret door.
I built this whole wing.
I kept firing the architects and builders, so no-one knew quite how it all fitted together.
I can slip in and out, anywhere I like, you know.
When I get the urge.
HH Holmes.
Murder Castle.
But done right.
I have a question for you.
Why are you here? It's like you walked into my den and laid down in front of me.
Why? You know why I'm here.
I'd like to hear you say it.
Say it for me, please.
I want you to kill me.
[HIGH-TEMPO MUSIC] MRS HUDSON: John? My car.
If you increased the dosage four or five times, toxic shock should shut me down within about an hour.
Then I restore the settings.
Everyone assumes it was a fault, or - you just gave up the ghost.
- Yes.
You're rather good at this.
Before we start, tell me how you feel.
I I feel scared.
Be more specific.
You only get to do this the once.
I'm scared of dying.
You wanted this, though.
I have reasons.
But you don't actually want to die.
No.
Good.
Say that for me.
- Say it.
- I don't want to die.
And again.
I don't want to die.
WHISPERS: Once more, for luck.
VOICE BREAKS: I don't want to die.
I don't.
I don't want to die.
Lovely.
Here it comes.
Please, I don't think he's safe.
LESTRADE: 'No, he's fine, I've got a man on the door.
' - 'What do you think's happened?' - I don't know, something! - Mary left a message.
- What message? 'John Watson never accepts help.
Not from anyone, not ever.
But here's the thing, he never refuses it.
So, here's what you are going to do.
' So, tell me, why are we doing this? To what do I owe the pleasure? I wanted to hear your confession, needed to know I was right.
But why do you need to die? The mortuary, your favourite room.
You talk to the dead.
You make your confession to them.
Sorry, sir, what? What do you mean? I think the door's jammed.
Oh, has that door locked itself again? Yeah, it's always doing that.
'You can't save John, because he won't let you.
He won't allow himself to be saved.
The only way to save John is to make him save you.
' Why do you do it? Why do I kill? It's not about hatred, or or revenge.
I'm not a dark person.
Killing human beings [HE CHUCKLES] it just makes me oh, incredibly happy.
You know, in films, when you see dead people, pretending to be dead, and it's just living people lying down? Well, that's not what dead people look like.
Dead people look like things.
I like to make people into things, then you can own them.
You know what? I'm getting a little impatient.
Take a big breath if you want.
'Go to hell, Sherlock.
Go right into hell and make it look like you mean it.
' Murder is a very difficult addiction to manage.
People don't realise how much work goes into it.
You have to be careful.
But if you're rich or famous and loved, it's amazing what people are prepared to ignore.
But there's always someone desperate about to go missing, and no-one wants to suspect murder if it's easier to suspect something else.
I just have to ration myself, choose the right heart to stop.
'Go and pick a fight with a bad guy, put yourself in harm's way.
' Please! Maintain eye contact.
Maintain eye contact.
Maintain eye contact! I like to watch it happen.
'If he thinks you need him, I swear' And off we pop.
'he will be there.
' [MONITORS BEEP RAPIDLY] - [SHERLOCK GASPS FOR AIR] - Mr Holmes, are you OK? What were you doing to him?! What were you doing?! - He's in distress, I'm helping him.
- Restrain him now.
Do it.
I was trying to help him! - Sherlock, what was he doing to you? - Suffocating me, overdosing me.
- On what? - Saline.
- Saline? - Yes, saline.
- What do you mean, saline? - [SHERLOCK GROANS] Well, obviously, I got Nurse Cornish to switch the bags.
She's a big fan, you know? Loves my blog.
- You're OK? - No, no, of course I'm not OK.
Malnourished, double kidney failure, and frankly, I've been off my tits for weeks.
What kind of a doctor are you? [SHERLOCK GROANS] I got my confession, though, didn't I? Well, I don't recall making any confession.
- What would I be confessing to? - You can listen to it later.
Well, there is no confession to listen to.
Oh, Mr Holmes, I don't know if this is relevant, but we found three potential recording devices in the pockets of your coat.
All your possessions were searched.
Sorry! Must be something comforting about the number three, people always give up after three.
What? What is it? What? [JOHN SIGHS] - You cock! - Yeah.
Utter, utter cock.
Heard you the first time.
- So, how does it open? - Screw the top.
- Two weeks ago? - Three.
- I'm that predictable? - No.
I'm just a cock.
It's funny.
I never realised confessing would be so enjoyable.
I should have done it sooner.
We'll carry on tomorrow.
Well, we could carry on now, I'm not tired.
There's loads more.
Tomorrow.
You know, I am going to be so famous now.
You're already famous.
Yeah, but with this I can break America.
I had, of course, several other backup plans.
Trouble is, I couldn't remember what they were.
And, of course, I hadn't really anticipated that I'd hallucinated meeting his daughter.
Basically, he trashed himself on drugs so that you'd help him, so that you'd have something to do, something doctory.
You get that now? Still a bit troubled by the daughter.
It did seem very real.
She gave me information I couldn't have acquired elsewhere.
But she wasn't ever here? Interesting, isn't it? I have theorised before that if one could attenuate to every available data stream in the world simultaneously, it would be possible to anticipate and deduce almost anything.
Hmm.
So, you dreamed up a magic woman who told you things you didn't know? Well, sounds about right to me.
Possibly, I'm biased.
Perhaps the drugs opened certain doors in my mind.
- I'm intrigued.
- I know you are.
Which is why we're all taking it in turns to keep you off the sweeties.
I thought we were just hanging out.
Molly will be here in 20 minutes.
Oh, I do think I can last 20 minutes without supervision.
Well, if you're sure.
Christ, John, stay, talk! Uh, sorry, it's just, um, you know, Rosie.
Yes, of course, Rosie.
Go and solve a crime together, make him wear the hat.
- You'll be OK for 20 minutes? - Yes, yes.
- Sorry, I I wasn't thinking of Rosie.
- No problem.
I should, er, come and see her soon.
Yes.
Actually, he should wear the hat as a special tribute to me.
I'm dead, I would really appreciate it.
Oh, by the way, the recordings will probably be inadmissible.
- Sorry, what? - Well, technically, it's entrapment, so it might get thrown out as evidence.
Not that that matters.
Apparently he can't stop confessing.
- That's good.
- Yeah.
- Are you OK? - [JOHN LAUGHS] What, am I? No, no, I'm not OK.
I'm never going to be OK.
And we'll just have to accept that.
It is what it is, and what it is is shit.
John, do better.
You didn't kill Mary.
Mary died saving your life.
It was her choice, no-one made her do it.
No-one could ever make her do anything.
The point is, you did not kill her.
In saving my life, she conferred a value on it.
It is a currency I do not know how to spend.
It is what it is.
I'm tomorrow, six till ten.
I'll see you then.
- Looking forward to it.
- Yeah.
[WOMAN GROANS] That noise, that's a text alert noise? What was that? Hmm? What was what? That's the text alert of Irene Adler.
She's the scary mad one, right? - That noise? - What noise? But she's dead.
[SHE GASPS] Ooh, I bet she isn't dead! I bet he saved her.
Oh, my God! Oh, the posh boy loves the dominatrix.
He's never knowingly under-cliched, is he? John? - I'm going to make a deduction.
- Oh, OK, that's good.
And if my deduction is right, you're going to be honest and tell me, OK? OK.
Though I should mention that it is possible for any given text alert - to become randomly attached to - Happy birthday.
Thank you, John, that's very kind of you.
Never knew when your birthday was.
Well, now you do.
Seriously, we're not going to - talk about this? - Talk about what? I mean, how does it work? How does what work? You and The Woman.
Do you go to a discreet Harvester sometimes? Is there nights of passion in High Wycombe? Oh, for God's sakes, I don't text her back! LAUGHS: Why not? You bloody moron! She's out there, she likes you and she's alive! And do you have the first idea how lucky you are?! Yes, she's a lunatic, she's a criminal, she's insanely dangerous.
Trust you to fall for a sociopath! Oh, married an assassin! But she's, you know - What? - Just text - her back.
- Why? Because High Wycombe is better than you are currently equipped to understand! I once caught a triple poisoner in High Wycombe.
That's only the beginning, mate.
As I think I have explained to you many times before, romantic entanglement, while fulfilling for other people - Would complete you as a human being.
- That doesn't even mean anything.
Just text her, phone her, do something while there's still a chance, because that chance doesn't last forever.
Trust me, Sherlock, it's gone before you know it.
Before you know it! She was wrong about me.
Mary? How so? She thought that if you put yourself in harm's way, I'd I'd rescue you, or something.
But I didn't, not till she told me to.
And that's how this works, that's what you're missing.
She taught me to be the man she already thought I was.
Get yourself a piece of that.
Forgive me, but you are doing yourself a disservice.
I have known many people in this world, but made few friends, and I can safely say I cheated on her.
No clever comeback? I cheated on you, Mary.
There was a woman on the bus, and I had a plastic daisy in my hair, I'd been playing with Rosie.
And this girl just smiled at me.
That's all it was, it was a smile.
We texted, constantly.
You want to know when? Every time you left the room, that's when.
When you were feeding our daughter.
When you were stopping her from crying, that's when.
And that's all it was.
Just texting.
But I wanted more.
And do you know something? I still do.
I'm not the man you thought I was, I'm not that guy.
I never could be.
But that's the point.
VOICE BREAKS: That's the whole point.
Who you thought I was is the man who I want to be.
Well, then John Watson get the hell on with it.
[JOHN SOBS] - It's OK.
- It's not OK.
No but it is what it is.
So, Molly's going to meet us at this cake place.
Well, it's your birthday.
Cake is obligatory.
Oh, well, I suppose a sugar high is some sort of substitute.
Behave.
Right then.
You know, it's not my place to say, but it was just texting.
People text.
Even I text.
Her, I mean.
Woman.
Bad idea.
Try not to, but, you know, sometimes It's not a pleasant thought, John, but I have this terrible feeling from time to time that we might all just be human.
- Even you? - No.
Even you.
- Cake? - Cake! Oh, um What? What is it? What's wrong? [JOHN LAUGHS] Seriously? I'm Sherlock Holmes, I wear the damn hat! Isn't that right, Mary? You seem so much better, John.
Yeah, I I am.
I think I am.
Not all day, not every day, but, you know.
- It is what it is? - Yeah.
And Rosie? Beautiful, perfect.
Unprecedented in the history of children.
That's not my bias, that's scientific fact.
- Good.
And Sherlock Holmes? - Back to normal.
'Get out!' She's possessed by the devil! I swear, my wife is channelling Satan! Yes, boring, go away! I'm not channelling Satan! Why not, given your immediately alternative? - What about his brother? - Mycroft? He's fine.
So, you're off now.
I won't see you for a week? Just spending it at home.
Unless she calls.
The PM.
Here.
What's this? - My number.
- I already have your number.
- My private number.
- Why would I need that? I don't know.
Maybe you'd like a drink sometime.
- Of what? - Up to you.
Call me.
[HE CHUCKLES] I mean, obviously, "normal" and "fine" are both relative terms when it comes to Sherlock and Mycroft.
Obviously.
She was real.
'But I didn't mean Mycroft.
' I meant the other one.
Which other one? You know, the secret one.
Oh, that was just something I said.
I'm sure there's How did you know about that? I didn't tell you that.
- You must have done.
- I really didn't.
Well, maybe Sherlock told me.
But you've met Sherlock exactly once, in this room, he was off his head.
Oh, no, no, I met him before that.
When? We spent a night together.
It was lovely.
We had chips.
IN NORTHERN ACCENT: "You're not what I expected, Mr Holmes.
" "You're nicer.
" Culverton gave me Faith's original note.
A mutual friend put us in touch.
Did Sherlock ever tell you about the note? I added some deductions for Sherlock.
He was quite good.
But he didn't get the big one.
In fairness, though, he does have excellent taste in chips.
- What's that? - What's what? The flower in your hair, it's like I had on the bus.
You looked very sweet.
But then "You have such nice eyes.
" Amazing the times a man doesn't really look at your face.
Oh, you can hide behind a sexy smile or a walking cane, or just be a therapist, talking about you all the time.
Oh, please don't go anywhere, I'm sure the therapist who actually lives here wouldn't want blood on the carpet.
Oh, hang on, it's fine.
She's in a sack in the airing cupboard.
- Who are you? - Isn't it obvious? Haven't you guessed? I'm Eurus.
Eurus? Silly name, isn't it? Greek.
Means "the east wind".
My parents loved silly names, like Eurus or Mycroft or Sherlock.
Oh, look at him.
Didn't it ever occur to you, not even once, that Sherlock's secret brother might just be Sherlock's secret sister? Huh? He's making a funny face.
I think I'll put a hole in it.
Mummy? Mummy! Wake up! Wake up! Mummy! [BLEEPING] [CLATTER] [RUMBLING] Wake up! [PHONE RINGS] Help me, please! I'm on a plane and everyone's asleep! Help me! PHONE: 'Hello.
My name's Jim Moriarty.
'Welcome to the final problem.
' - 'You know, I could arrest you.
- What for? - 'Wearing a dress like that.
- Would you like me to take it off? - 'Then I'd really have to press charges.
- Press away.
'Isn't that how they got started? - 'Who? - Adam and Eve.
- Oh, them.
- And that turned out OK.
'You think so? 'I thought it was supposed to be the beginning of all human misery.
'Now, what was all that about arresting me? - 'Well, maybe not arresting you.
- No? 'I could just keep you under close watch.
- 'Very close? - A-huh.
'Shame, I was looking forward to putting myself into the hands of the authorities.
'You were? 'Finger-printing, being searched thoroughly.
' EERIE WHISPER: Mycroft? [FOOTSTEPS] [DOOR OPENS] [DOOR CREAKS] DOOR SLAMS SHU [POP!] [CLOCK CHIMES] EERIE WHISPER: Mycroft? Why don't you come out and show yourself? I don't have time for this.
CHILD: We have time, Mycroft.
All the time in the world.
Mycroft? Who are you? SINGSONG: You know.
Impossible.
Nothing's impossible.
You of all people know that.
It's coming to get you.
There's an east wind coming, Mycroft.
Coming to get you.
You can't have got out! You can't! [CLICK] No use, Mycroft.
There's no defence and nowhere to hide.
Y-a-a-a-argh! Sherlock? Help me! [HE WHISTLES] Experiment complete.
Conclusion, I have a sister.
This was you? All of this was you?! Conclusion two, my sister, Eurus, apparently, has been incarcerated from an early age in a secure institution controlled by my brother.
Hey, Bro! Why would you do this, this pantomime? Why?! Conclusion three, you are terrified of her.
You have no idea what you're dealing with.
None at all! New information, she's out.
That's not possible.
It's more than possible, she was John's therapist.
- Shot me during a session.
- Only with a tranquilliser.
- Hm.
We still had ten minutes to go.
- Well, we'll see about a refund.
Right, you two, Wiggins has got your money by the gate, don't spend it all in one crack den.
[SQUEAK!] Oh, I hope we didn't spoil your enjoyment of the movie.
You're just leaving?! Well, we're not staying here, Eurus is coming and, er someone's disabled all your security.
Sleep well! Dr Watson, why would he do that to me? That was insane! Er yes, well, someone convinced him that you wouldn't tell the truth unless you were actually wetting yourself.
Someone? Probably me.
So, that's it, is it? You're just going? Well, don't worry, there's a place for people like you, the desperate, the terrified.
The ones with nowhere else to run.
What place? 221B Baker Street.
See you in the morning.
If there's a queue, join it.
For God's sake, this is not one of your idiot cases! You might want to close that window.
There is an east wind coming.
You have to sit in the chair.
They won't talk to you unless you sit in the chair, it's the rules.
- I'm not a client! - Then get out.
She's not going to stay there, is she? - Would you like a cup of tea? - Thank you.
The kettle's over there.
So, what happens now? Are you going to make deductions? You're going to tell the truth, Mycroft.
Pure and simple.
Who was it said, "The truth is rarely pure and never simple"? I don't know and I don't care.
So, there were three of us, I know that now.
You, me and Eurus.
A sister I can't remember.
Interesting name, Eurus.
It's Greek, isn't it? Hm.
Yeah, literally, the God of the East Wind.
Yes.
"The east wind is coming, Sherlock.
" You used that to scare me.
- No.
- You turned my sister into a ghost story.
Of course I didn't.
I monitored you.
You what? Memories can resurface.
Wounds can reopen.
The roads we walk have demons beneath.
And yours have been waiting for a very long time.
I never bullied you.
I used, at discreet intervals, potential trigger words to update myself as to your mental condition.
I was looking after you.
Why can't I remember her? - This is a private matter.
- John stays.
- This is family! - That's why he stays! So there were three Holmes kids.
What was the age gap? Seven years between myself and Sherlock, one year between Sherlock and Eurus.
Middle child.
Explains a lot.
- So, did she have it, too? - Have what? The deduction thing.
The deduction thing? Yes.
More than you can know.
Enlighten me.
- You realise I'm the smart one? - As you never cease to announce.
But Eurus, she was incandescent, even then.
Our abilities were professionally assessed more than once.
I was remarkable, but Eurus was described as an era-defining genius.
Beyond Newton.
Then why don't I remember her? You do remember her, in a way.
Every choice you ever made, every path you've ever taken, the man you are today is your memory of Eurus.
She was different from the beginning.
She knew things she should never have known.
As if she was somehow aware of truths beyond the normal scope.
You look funny grown-up.
- What's wrong? - Sorry.
The memories are disturbing.
What do you mean? Examples.
They found her with a knife once.
She seemed to be cutting herself.
Mother and Father were terrified.
They thought it was a suicide attempt.
But when I asked Eurus what she was doing, she said: I wanted to see how my muscles worked.
- Jesus! - So I asked her if she felt pain, and she said: Which one's pain? Then what happened? Musgrave.
The ancestral home, where there was always honey for tea.
And Sherlock played among the - funny gravestones.
- Funny how? Come on, you lot! They weren't real.
The dates were all wrong.
An architectural joke which fascinated Sherlock.
Deep down below the old beech tree - Help succour me now the - East winds blow.
- East winds blow - 16 by six.
16 by six And under we go.
You're starting to remember.
Fragments.
Redbeard? Redbeard? - Redbeard? - He was my dog.
Eurus took Redbeard and locked him up somewhere no-one could find him.
- Redbeard? - And she refused to say where he was.
Redbeard? She'd only repeat that song.
Her little ritual.
We begged and begged her to tell us where he was.
But she said: The song is the answer.
But the song made no sense.
Brother, and under we go.
- What happened to Redbeard? - We never found him.
But she started calling him Drowned Redbeard, so we made our assumptions.
Sherlock was traumatised.
Natural, I suppose.
He was, in the early days, an emotional child.
But after that, he was different.
So changed.
Never spoke of it again.
In time, he seemed to forget that Eurus had ever even existed.
How could he forget? She was living in the same house.
No.
- They took her away.
- Why? You don't lock up a child because a dog goes missing.
Quite so.
It was what happened immediately afterwards.
FATHER: She knows where he is.
MOTHER: We can't make her tell us.
We can't make her do anything! [FLAMES ROAR] After that, our sister had - to be taken away.
- Where? Oh, some suitable place, or so everyone thought.
Not suitable enough, however.
- She died there.
- How? She started another fire.
One which she did not survive.
This is a lie.
Yes.
It is also a kindness.
This is the story I told our parents to spare them further pain, and to account for the absence of an identifiable body.
And no doubt to prevent their further interference.
Well, that, too, of course.
The depth of Eurus's psychosis and the extent of her abilities couldn't hope to be contained in any ordinary institution.
Uncle Rudi took care of things.
Where is she, Mycroft? Where's our sister? There's a place called Sherrinford.
An island.
It's a secure and very secret installation whose sole purpose is to contain what we call the uncontainables.
The demons beneath the road? This is where we trap them.
Sherrinford is more than a prison, or an asylum.
It is a fortress, built to keep the rest of the world safe from what is inside it.
Heaven may be a fantasy for the credulous and the afraid.
But I can give you a map reference for hell.
That's where our sister has been since early childhood.
She hasn't left, not for a single day.
Whoever you both met, it can't have been her.
[CRASH] I that am lost Oh, who will find me Deep down below the old beech tree? Help succour me now the east winds blow 16 by six, brother and under we go - Keep back! Keep as still as you can! - What is it? My soul seek the shade of my willow's bloom - It's a drone.
- Yeah, I can see that.
What's it carrying? What's that silver thing on top of it, Mycroft? It's a DX-707.
I've authorised the purchase of quite a number of these.
Colloquially, it is known as the patience grenade.
Patience? The motion sensor has activated.
If any of us move, the grenade - will detonate.
- How powerful? It'll certainly destroy this flat and kill anyone in it.
Assuming walls of reasonable strength, your neighbours should be safe, but as it's landed on the floor, I am moved to wonder if the cafe below is open.
- It's Sunday morning, so it's closed.
- What about Mrs Hudson? [MUSIC: The Number Of The Beast by Iron Maiden] Going by her usual routine, I estimate she has another two minutes left.
She keeps the vacuum cleaner at the back of the flat.
- So? - So safer there, when she's putting it away.
But we have to move eventually and we should do it when she's safest.
When the vacuum stops, we give her eight seconds to get to the back of the flat.
She's fast when she's cleaning.
Then we move.
What's the trigger response time? Once we're mobile, how long before detonation? We have a maximum of three seconds to vacate the blast radius.
John and I will take the windows, you take the stairs.
- Help get Mrs Hudson out, too.
- Me? - You're closer.
- You're faster.
Speed differential won't be as critical as the distance.
Yes, agreed.
She's further away.
She's moving to the back.
I estimate we have a minute left.
- Is a phone call possible? - Phone call? John has a daughter, he may wish to say goodbye.
I'm sorry, Dr Watson, any movement will set off the grenade.
I hope you understand.
Oscar Wilde.
What? He said, "The truth is rarely pure and never simple".
It's from The Importance Of Being Earnest.
We did it at school.
So did we, now I recall.
I was Lady Bracknell.
Yeah.
You were great.
- You really think so? - Yes, I really do.
Well, that's good to know.
I've always wondered.
Good luck, boys.
Three, two, one, go! [FLAMES ROAR] 'And now the shipping forecast, issued by the Met Office 'on behalf of the Maritime Coastguard Agency at 05.
05.
'Thames, Dover' Go on, son, get it up.
Better out than in.
GASPS FOR BREATH: Is it always like this? - No.
- Thank God! Usually, it's much worse.
I might go and work in a bank! Is that an helicopter? No, not in this weather.
'Shannon, Malin, Sherrinford.
'Sherrinford.
'Sherrinford.
' - Do you hear that? - 'Sherrinford.
' I never heard that one before.
Sherrinford? Forget you ever heard it.
What? Sometimes when we're out in these waters, we get that message.
Just forget about it.
- Yeah, but we've never - Just! [THUD] - Who the hell are you?! - My name's Sherlock Holmes.
The detective.
The pirate.
Golf Whiskey X-ray, this is a restricted area.
Repeat, restricted area.
You are off course.
Are you receiving? Golf Whiskey X-ray, you are off course.
Are you receiving? 'We are receiving you.
This is a distress call.
'Repeat, distress call.
We're in trouble here.
' Golf Whiskey X-ray, what is your situation? Golf Whiskey X-ray, where are you now? 'We're headed for the rocks, we're going to hit!' Governor to the control room! TANNOY: 'Lockdown in progress! Lockdown in progress! 'Please proceed to designated red stations.
'Please proceed to designated red stations.
' [SIREN WAILS] - Hold it! Wait, wait, wait! - Wait! Wait! In the sand! In the sand! I need to speak to Mycroft.
He's in hospital, there was an explosion.
Put me through to the hospital.
He's not conscious.
He's severely injured.
No-one is even confident he's going to pull through.
Where's his brother? Where's Sherlock Holmes? Missing.
No, he's not, he's here! Sir, we found two more from the boat.
'He stole our boat! Him and another fella, with guns!' - Where'd you find them? - 'North side of the island, sir.
' - Holding cell, now! - 'Right, sir.
' TANNOY: 'Lockdown in progress.
' This is a mistake! I'm the victim here, this man stole my boat! He's a pirate.
- Yeah, I really am.
- Please, sit down.
I don't even know who he is! He's Dr John Watson, formerly of the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers.
- What are you doing here? - It's a hospital.
Any work? It's not a hospital.
I want eyes on Eurus Holmes.
Go straight to the special unit, deploy green and yellow shift, on my authority.
Sir.
I'm sparing your blushes because we're supposed to be on the same side.
And frankly, this is embarrassing.
Ooh.
Doing a cavity search? The true art of disguise, according to your famous friend, is not being looked at.
But I am looking at you, aren't I, Mr Holmes? Yes, you are.
But that is sort of the point, isn't it? You see, you should have been looking at the guy you just gave your pass to.
Ah! That's the trouble with uniforms and name badges, people stop looking at faces.
We'd be better off with clown outfits.
At least they'd be satirically relevant.
Oh, you'll find the real Landers on the north shore, tied up with two others.
- Two others? - Hm.
Well, it was trial and error.
We had to find the right waistband.
This is insane! This is unnecessary.
No, your security is compromised and we don't know who to trust.
And that justifies dressing up? Yes, it does! It justifies dressing up or any damn thing I say it does! Now, listen to me, for your own physical safety, do not speak.
Do not indulge in any non-verbal signals suggestive of internal thought! If the safety of my sister is compromised, if the security of my sister is compromised, if the incarceration of my sister is compromised, in short, if I find any indication my sister has left this island at any time, I swear to you, you will not! - Say thank you to Dr Watson.
- Why? He talked me out of Lady Bracknell.
This could have been very different.
Are you in? Just arriving at the secure unit.
Explain.
'Door opening.
' Prison within a prison.
Eurus must be allowed the strict minimum of human interaction.
- Why? - Since you're determined to meet her, you're about to find out.
Eyes on Eurus Holmes.
Governor's orders.
Answer yes or no.
Has there ever been, against my express instructions, any attempt at a psychiatric evaluation of Eurus Holmes? - Yes.
- I presume the tapes are in my office.
- Your office? - Cast your mind back.
It used to be yours.
You haven't been down here before, have you? Silence Of The Lambs, basically.
- You what? - Keep your distance.
Stay at least three feet away from the glass, and all that.
Why the headphones? She doesn't stop playing.
Sometimes for weeks.
Beautiful.
- Kills you in the end.
- Aye, still beautiful, though.
'Door closing.
' [VIOLIN PLAYS] [SHE STOPS PLAYING] [SHE RESUMES PLAYING] 'Why am I here? 'Why do you think you're here? 'No-one ever tells me.
' [PLAYING CONTINUES] [PLAYING SPEEDS UP] [SLOWS DOWN] - 'Am I being punished? - You've been bad.
'There's no such thing as bad.
- 'What about good? - Good and bad are fairytales.
'We have evolved to attach an emotional significance 'to what is nothing more than a survival strategy of the pack animal.
'We are conditioned to invest divinity in utility.
'Good isn't really good, evil isn't really wrong, 'bottoms aren't really pretty.
You are a prisoner of your own meat.
'Why aren't you? 'I'm too clever.
' [MUSIC CONTINUES] - THROUGH SPEAKERS: Did you bring it? - Sorry? My hairband.
Did you bring it, like I asked? I'm not one of the I-I don't work here.
My special hairband.
I'm not one of your doctors.
The one I made you steal from Mummy.
It was the last thing I said to you, remember? The day they took me away.
No.
- No? - We've spoken since then.
You came round to my flat a few weeks back, you pretended to be a woman called Faith Smith.
We had chips.
Does this mean you didn't bring my hairband? How did you manage to get out of this place? How did you do that? Easy.
Look at me.
I am looking at you.
You can't see it, can you? You try and try, but you just can't see, you can't look.
See what? - What do you think? - Beautiful.
- You're not looking at it.
- I meant your playing.
Oh, the music! I never know if it's beautiful or not, only if it's right.
Often they're the same thing.
If they're not always the same thing, what's the point in beauty? Look at the violin.
I need to know how you escaped.
Look at the violin.
- It's a Stradivarius.
- It's a gift.
- Who from? - Me.
- Why? - You play, don't you? How did you know? How did I know? I taught you.
Don't you remember? How can you not remember that? Eurus, I don't remember you at all.
Interesting.
Mycroft told me you'd rewritten your memories, he didn't tell me you'd written me out completely.
What do you mean, rewritten? You still don't know about Redbeard, do you? Oh! This is going to be such a good day.
'She smiles at you when you come home' Everyone we sent in there, it's hard to describe, - it's it's like she - Recruited them.
'Smiling is advertising.
' Enslaved them.
She's been capable of that since she was five.
She's an adult now.
I warned you.
I ordered you.
She's clinically unique.
We had to try.
At what cost? 'Happiness is a pop song.
Sadness is a poem.
' What cost? Tell me the worst thing that has happened.
She kept suggesting to Dr Taylor that he should kill his family.
- And? - He said it was like an earworm, couldn't get her out of his head.
- And? - He left.
- And? - Killed himself.
And? His family.
'Are you going to cry? 'It's OK if you cry.
'I don't want to cry.
'I can help you cry.
' - Play for me.
- I need to know how you got out of here.
You know already! Look at me.
Look and play.
[HE BEGINS TO PLAY] No, not Bach.
You clearly don't understand it.
Play you.
- Me? - You.
[HE BEGINS TO PLAY] Oh! Have you had sex? Why do you ask? The music.
I've had sex.
How? One of the nurses got careless.
I liked it.
Messy, though.
People are so breakable.
I take it he didn't consent.
- He? - She? Afraid I didn't notice in the heat of the moment.
And afterwards, well, you couldn't really tell.
Is that vibrato, or is your hand shaking? I warned you explicitly, no-one was to talk to her alone.
- You spoke to her.
- I know what I'm doing! You even brought her a visitor on Christmas Day.
I took a calculated risk.
You gave her a Christmas present.
Remember her Christmas present? I am aware of the dangers Eurus poses and equipped to deal with them.
What dangers? Eurus doesn't just talk to people, she reprograms them.
Anyone who spends time with her is automatically compromised.
'I'm only trying to help you.
We can help each other.
'Helping someone is the best way you can help yourself.
'I don't trust you.
' So, clearly you remember me? I remember everything.
Every single thing.
You just need a big enough hard drive.
- WATSON: 'Sherlock?' - Not now.
- 'Vatican Cameos.
' - In a minute.
Let's continue.
Did they tell you to keep three feet from the glass? - Yes.
- Be naughty, step closer.
- Why? - Do it.
Step closer.
Tell me what you remember.
You, me and Mycroft.
Mycroft was quite clever.
He could understand things if you went a bit slow, but you, you were my favourite.
Why was I your favourite? Because I could make you laugh.
I loved it when you laughed.
Once, I made you laugh all night, I thought you were going to burst.
I was so happy.
Then Mummy and Daddy had to stop me, of course.
- Why? - Well, turns out I'd got it wrong.
Apparently, you were screaming.
Why was I screaming? [FAINT WHIMPERING] Redbeard! - I remember Redbeard.
- Do you now? Tell me what I don't know.
Touch the glass.
I put my trust in you, my implicit trust, as governor of this institute! [GULLS CRY] [WAVES CRASH] It's obvious when it all started.
Well, she was never the same after that Christmas.
It's as if you woke her up.
That is entirely beside the point! - You had your orders and failed to act on them.
- Listen to the tape.
- Sorry? - Do it now, listen.
- My sister's methods of - Just listen.
'You have no idea how I could help.
'Bring me your wife.
I want to meet her.
MAN: 'I don't need your help.
' Redbeard was my dog.
I know what happened to Redbeard.
Oh, Sherlock, you know nothing.
Touch the glass and I'll tell you the truth.
I'll touch it, too, if you're scared.
'I can fix her for you and then I'll give you her straight back, 'good as new, I promise.
'That's all.
What you're proposing is not It's not right.
' Everyone who went in there got affected.
- Enslaved, you said.
- Yes.
- One after the other? - Yes.
- Dr Watson, I think we've - Shut up! EURUS: 'Do you trust your wife?' One question, that's your voice, isn't it? 'Do you really? Do you trust her? 'You've got to stop saying these things.
' If Eurus has enslaved you, then who exactly is in charge of this prison? 'It's completely inappropriate.
' I'm sorry.
- No! - Very, very sorry.
- No! - [ALARM WAILS] You think it's a trick.
You look so unsure.
You're not used to being unsure, are you? It's more common than you'd think.
Look at you.
The man who sees through everything is exactly the man who doesn't notice when there's nothing to see through.
Do you see how it was done? I know you like explanations.
The signs, you suspended the signs! And my voice? Throat mic.
Puts me through the speakers.
DIRECT VOICE: Don't you think it's clever? - Simple, but clever.
- Transparent.
Well, you do keep asking me how I got out of here.
Like this.
Ooof! Argh! A-A-A-A-A-A-Argh! Get in here, all of you! Stop me killing him! COMPOSED: No, no, stop me in a minute.
A-A-A-A-A-A-Argh! Oh! TANNOY: 'Red alert! Red alert! 'Big, red, bouncy, red alert!' - Dr Watson! - 'Klingons attacking lower decks! 'Also cowboys in black hats and Darth Vader.
'Don't be alarmed! I'm here now, I'm here now! 'Did you miss me? Did you miss me? 'Miss me? Miss me? 'Miss me? Miss me? 'Miss me? Miss me? Miss me? Miss me? 'Miss me? Miss me? Miss me? Miss me?' [MUSIC: I Want To Break Free by Queen] I want to break free I want to break free I want to break free from your lies You're so self-satisfied I don't need you I've got to break free [RAPTUROUS APPLAUSE] God knows God knows I want to break free I've fallen in [MUSIC STOPS] - Mr Moriarty.
- Big G.
Big G means Governor.
Street speak.
I'm a bit down with the kids, you know.
I'm relatable that way.
Do you like my boys? This one's got more stamina, but he's less caring in the afterglow.
This way, please.
Smell all that insane criminality.
[HE INHALES] Do you have cannibals here? - Yes.
Three.
- How many? That's good.
People leave their bodies to science, I think cannibals would be so much more grateful.
[HE WHISTLES] [FAINT VOICES] Ah! [HE CHUCKLES] Ah! Isn't that sweet? Won't you sit down? I wrote my own version of the Nativity when I was a child.
The Hungry Donkey.
It was a bit gory, but if you're going to put a baby in a manger, you're asking for trouble.
You know what this place is, of course? Of course.
So, am I under arrest again? You remain a person of interest, but until you commit a verifiable crime, you are, I regret, at liberty.
- Then why am I here? - You're a Christmas present.
Ah.
How do you want me? There is, in this facility, a prisoner whose intellectual abilities are of occasional use to the British government.
What, for, like, really difficult sums, long division, that sort of thing? She predicted the exact dates of the last three terrorist attacks on the British mainland after an hour on Twitter.
That sort of thing.
In return, however, she requires treats.
Last year, it was a violin.
This year? Five minutes unsupervised conversation with you.
Me? With me? She has noted your interest in the activities of my little brother.
So, what has she got to do with Sherlock Holmes? Whatever you're about to tell me I already know it's going to be awesome! I'm your Christmas present.
So, what's mine? Redbeard.
[HE GROANS] How are you? - Bit of a lump.
- True, that, but you have your uses.
- Did you see your sister? - Yes.
- How was that? - Family is always difficult.
Is this an occasion for banter? Case in point.
[RINGING TONE] - Are we phoning someone? - Apparently.
- What's he doing here? - As he is told.
Eurus is in control.
[PHONE CONNECTS] Help me.
Please, I'm on a plane and everyone's asleep! Help me! 'Hello.
My name's Jim Moriarty.
'Welcome to the final problem.
' - It's OK, he's dead.
- He doesn't sound dead.
'This is a recorded announcement.
'Please say hello to some very old friends of mine.
' Hello? I can hear you talking.
'Please help me! I'm on a plane and it's going to crash!' - What is this? We can't do this! - Do shut up, dear.
- 'Is someone there?!' - Is this supposed to be a game? - Be quiet.
- 'Please help me!' Oh, hello.
Um try try to stay calm.
Just tell me tell me what your name is.
I'm not supposed to tell my name to strangers.
Of course not, very good.
But, um I'll tell you mine.
- My name is - [WHITE NOISE] Hello? Oh, dear.
We seem to have lost the connection.
How have you done this? How is any of this possible? You put me in here, Mycroft, you brought me my treats.
What treats? 'Clever, Eurus! You go, girl!' How can that be Moriarty? Oh, he recorded lots of little messages for me before he died.
Loved it.
Did you know his brother was a stationmaster? I think he was always jealous.
The girl, where is she? Can I talk to her again? Poor little thing.
Alone in the sky in a great big plane with nowhere to land.
But where in the world is she? It's a clever little puzzle.
If you want to apply yourself to it, I can reconnect you, but first That's my wife.
That's my wife! Oh, God, that's my wife! I'm going to shoot the governor's wife.
Please! No! Please! Help her! In about a minute bang! Dead! - Please don't do that.
- Well, you can stop me.
- How? - There's a gun in the hatch.
Take it.
You want to save the governor's wife, choose either Dr Watson or Mycroft to kill the governor.
Oh! Oh, God! You can't do it, Sherlock.
If you do it, it won't count.
I'll kill her, anyway.
It has to be your brother or your friend.
You have to do this.
Eurus will kill her! It doesn't appear we have a choice.
Right, then.
Countdown's starting.
How long? No, no, no, the countdown is for me.
Withholding the precise deadline will apply the emotional pressure more evenly.
Where possible, please give me an explicit verbal indication of your anxiety levels, I can't always read them from your behaviour.
I can't do this.
I can't, it's murder.
This is not murder, this is saving my wife.
I'm particularly focused on internal conflicts, where strategising around a largely-intuitive moral code appears to create a counterintuitive result.
I will not kill.
I will not have blood on my hands! Yes, very good.
Thank you.
Killing my wife is what you are doing.
No! OK, fine.
John? Dr Watson, are you married? I was.
- What happened? - She died.
What would you give to get her back? I mean, if you could, if it was possible, what would you do to save her? Eurus will kill me.
Please save my wife.
There will, I'm afraid, be regular prompts to create an atmosphere of urgency.
MORIARTY: 'Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock.
'Tick-tick-tick-tick, tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock.
' What's your name? David.
And you're sure about this, David? Of course I'm bloody sure! Nearly there.
Right, do you want to pray or anything? With Eurus Holmes in the world, who the hell would I pray to? You are a good man and you are doing a good thing.
So are you.
I'll spend the rest of my life telling myself that.
Please! Oh, God! I know that you're scared, but you should also be very proud.
Just do it! Be quick! MORIARTY: 'Tick-tick-tick-tick-tick-tick.
' This is very good, Dr Watson.
I should have fitted you with a cardiograph.
Goodbye, David.
'Tock-tock-tock-tock-tock-tock-tock, tick-tick-tick.
' SOBS: Please! I can't.
I'm sorry, I can't do it.
I know, it's all right.
Stop! No, no! Stop! I'm sorry.
- It's all right.
- I'm so sorry! Remember me.
- No! - [GUNSHOT] Oh! [HE VOMITS] Are you all right? Interesting.
All right, there you go, you got what you wanted, and he's dead.
Dead or alive, he really wasn't very interesting.
But you three, you three were wonderful.
Thank you.
You see, what you did, Dr Watson, specifically because of your moral code, because you don't want blood on your hands, two people are dead instead of one.
Two people? Yes.
Sorry.
Hang on.
[GUNSHOT] Oh! [HE EXHALES] What advantage did your moral code grant you? Is it not, in the end, selfish to keep one's hands clean at the expense of another's life? You didn't have to kill her! Huh! The condition of her survival was that you or Mycroft had to kill her husband.
This is an experiment.
There will be rigour.
Sherlock, pick up the gun.
It's your turn next.
When I tell you to use it, and I will, remember what happened this time.
What if I don't want a gun? Oh, the gun is intended as a mercy.
- For whom? - You.
- How so? - If someone else had to die, would you really want to do it with your bare hands? It would waste valuable time.
Probably just take it.
There's only one bullet left.
You will only need one.
But you will need it.
[DOOR OPENS] Please, go through.
There's a few tasks for you and a girl on a plane is getting very, very scared.
Treats? Yes.
You know, a violin.
In exchange for? She's very clever.
I'm beginning to think you're not.
MORIARTY: 'Come on now, all aboard! 'Choo-choo! Choo-choo! Choo-choo! 'Choo-choo! Choo-choo! 'Choo-choo! 'Choo-choo! Choo-choo!' Someone's been redecorating.
- Is that allowed? - She's literally taken over the asylum, we have more to worry about than her choice of colour scheme.
Barely dry.
Recent.
And it's for our benefit.
As a motivator to your continued cooperation, I'm now reconnecting you.
'Fasten your seatbelts, it's going to be a bumpy night.
' GIRL: 'Are are you still there?' Yes, hello? Hello, we're still here, can you hear us? - Yes.
- 'Everything is going to be all right, 'I-I just need you to tell me where you are.
'Outside, is it day or night?' - Night.
- That certainly narrows it down to half the planet! - What kind of a plane are you on - 'I don't know.
' - Is it big or small? - 'Big.
' Lots of people on it? Lots and lots, but they're all asleep, I can't wake them up.
- Where did you take off from? - 'And the driver's asleep.
' No, I understand, but where did you come from? 'Where did the plane take off?' - My nan's.
- And where are you going? - 'Home.
' - No, I mean what airport Enough for now.
Time to play a new game.
Look on the table in front of you.
Open the envelope.
If you want to speak to the girl again, earn yourself some phone time! This is inhuman, this is insane! Mycroft, we know! Six months ago, a man called Evans was murdered.
Unsolved, except by me.
He was shot from a distance of 300 metres with this rifle.
Now, if the police had any brains, they'd realise there are three suspects, all brothers, Nathan Garrideb, Alex Garrideb and Howard Garrideb.
All these photos are up to date, but which one pulled the trigger, Sherlock? Which one? What's this, we're supposed to solve this based on what? This.
This is all we get.
Please, make use of your friends, Sherlock.
I want to see you interact with people that you're close to.
Also, you may have to choose which one to keep.
What do you make of it? Am I being asked to prove my usefulness? Yes, I should think you are.
I will not be manipulated like this.
Fine.
John? John! Yeah, I think I've seen one of these.
It's a buffalo gun.
I'd say 1940s, old-fashioned sight.
No crosshairs.
Glasses, glasses.
Nathan wears glasses.
Evans was shot from 300 metres.
The kickback from a gun with this calibre would be massive.
No cuts, no scarring.
It's not Nathan, then.
Who's next? Well done, Dr Watson.
How useful you are.
Do you have a suspicion we're being made to compete? We're not competing.
There's a plane in the air that's going to crash, so what we're doing is trying to save a little girl.
Today, we have to be soldiers, Mycroft, soldiers.
And that means to hell with what happens to us! Your priorities do you credit.
No, my priorities just got a woman killed.
Now, as I understand it, Sherlock, you try to repress your emotions to refine your reasoning.
I'd like to see how that works.
So, if you don't mind, I'm going to apply some context to your deductions.
Oh, dear God! Two of the Garridebs work here as orderlies, so getting the third along really wasn't too difficult.
Once you bring in your verdict, let me know and justice will be done.
- Justice? - What will you do with them? Early release.
You'll drop them into the sea.
Sink or swim.
They're tied up! Exactly! Now there is context.
Please continue with your deductions.
I'm now focusing on the difference to your mental capacity a specified consequence can make.
Why should we bother? What if we're disinclined to play your games, little sister? Hm-hm! I have, if you remember, provided you with some motivation.
GIRL: 'We're going through the clouds, like cotton wool.
' Oh, that's nice.
Try to tell me more about the plane.
Why won't my mummy wake up? [CALL DISCONNECTS] So it's got to be one of the other two.
Now, Howard Howard's a lifelong drunk, pallor of his skin, terminal gin blossoms on his red nose.
And, terror notwithstanding, a bad case of the DTs.
There's no way he could have taken that shot from 300 metres way.
So that leaves us with Alex.
Indentations on the temples suggest he habitually wears glasses.
Frown lines suggest a lifetime of peering.
He's short-sighted, or he was.
His recent laser surgery has done the trick.
- Laser surgery? - Look at his clothes, he's made an effort.
- That's very good.
- Excellent.
Suddenly he sees himself in quite a different light now that he's dumped the specs.
He even has a spray tan.
But he's clearly not used to his new personal grooming ritual.
That can be told by the state of his fingernails and the fact that there's hair growing in his ears.
So it's a superficial job, then.
But he got his eyes fixed, his hands were steady.
He pulled the trigger.
He killed Evans.
Are you ready to condemn the prisoner? Sherlock, we can't do this.
The plane, remember? Sherlock, are you ready? Alex.
Say it.
Condemn him.
Condemn him in the knowledge of what will happen to the man you name.
I condemn Alex Garrideb.
MORIARTY: 'Mind the gap.
' Congratulations, you got the right one.
Now, go through the door.
You dropped the other two, why? - Interesting.
- Why?! Does it really make a difference, killing the innocent instead of the guilty? Let's see.
'The train has left the station!' No.
That felt pretty much the same.
John? Don't let her distract you.
- Distract me? - Soldiers today.
One more minute on the phone.
GIRL: 'I'm frightened! I'm really frightened!' It's OK, don't worry.
I don't have very long with you, so I just need you tell me what you can see outside the plane.
Just the sea.
I can see the sea.
- Are there ships on it? - 'No ships.
'I can see lights in the distance.
' - Is it a city? - 'I think so.
' She's about to fly over a city in a pilotless plane.
We'll have to talk her through it.
- Through what? - 'Hello? Are you still there?' Still here.
Just give us a minute.
Getting the plane away from any mainland, any populated areas.
- It has to crash in the sea.
- What about the girl? Well, obviously, Dr Watson, she's the one who's going to crash it.
No.
We could help her land it.
And if we fail and she crashes into a city? How many will die then? How are we going to get her to do that? I'm afraid we're going to have to give her hope.
Is there really no-one there that can help you? Have you really, really checked? Everyone's asleep.
Will you help me? We're going to do everything that we can.
'I'm scared.
I'm really scared!' It's all right, I EURUS: Now, back to the matter in hand.
Coffin.
Problem, someone is about to die.
It will be, as I understand it, a tragedy.
So many days not lived, so many words unsaid, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera Yes, yes, yes, and this, I presume, will be their coffin.
Whose coffin, Sherlock? Please, start your deductions.
I will apply some context in a moment.
Well, allowing for the entirely pointless courtesy of headroom, I'd say this coffin is intended for someone of about five foot four.
- Makes it more likely to be a woman.
- Not a child? A child's would be more expensive.
This is in the lower price range, although still best available in that bracket.
That was a lonely night on Google.
This is a practical and informed choice.
The balance of probability suggests that this is for an unmarried woman, distant from her close relatives.
That is suggested by the economy of choice, acquainted with the process of death, but unsentimental about the necessity of disposal.
The lining of the coffin Yes, very good, Sherlock, or we could just look at the name on the lid.
Only it isn't a name.
So it's for somebody who loves somebody.
It's for somebody who loves Sherlock.
This is all about you, everything here.
So, who loves you? I'm assuming it's not a long list.
Irene Adler.
Don't be ridiculous.
Look at the coffin.
Unmarried, practical about death, alone.
- Molly.
- Molly Hooper.
She's perfectly safe, for the moment.
Her flat is rigged to explode in approximately three minutes, unless I hear the release code from her lips.
I'm calling her on your phone, Sherlock.
- Make her say it.
- Say what? Obvious, surely.
- No.
- Yes.
Oh, one important restriction, you're not allowed to mention in any way at all that her life is in danger.
You may not, at any point, suggest that there is any form of crisis.
If you do, I will end this session and her life.
Are we clear? MORIARTY: 'Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock, 'tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tick' [PHONE RINGS] - What's she doing? - She's making tea.
But why isn't she answering her phone? You never answer your phone.
Yes, but it's me calling.
ANSWERPHONE: 'Hi, this is Molly at the dead centre of town.
'Leave a message.
' OK, OK.
Just one more time.
[DIALLING TONE] [PHONE RINGS] Go on, Molly, pick up.
Just bloody pick up.
[PHONE RINGS] 'Hello, Sherlock.
Is this urgent? Because I'm not having a good day.
' Molly, I just want you to do something very easy for me and not ask why.
Oh, God! Is this one of your stupid games? No, it's not a game.
I need you to help me.
- Look, I'm not at the lab.
- It's not about that.
Well, quickly, then.
Sherlock! What is it, what do you want? 'Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock' Molly, please, without asking why, just say these words.
What words? I love you.
- Leave me alone.
- Molly, no, please, no! Don't hang up! Do not hang up! Calmly, Sherlock, or I will finish her right now.
Why are you doing this to me?! Why are you making fun of me?! Please, I swear, you just have to listen to me.
Softer, Sherlock.
Molly, this is for a case.
It's it's a sort of experiment.
I'm not an experiment, Sherlock.
No, I know you're not an experiment, you're my friend.
We're friends, but, please, just say those words for me.
Please don't do this.
Just just don't do it.
It's very important.
I can't say why.
But I promise you, it is.
I can't say that, I can't I can't say that to you.
Of course you can.
Why can't you? 'You know why.
' No, I don't know why.
[SHE SIGHS] Of course you do.
'Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock, 'tick-tick-tick-tick-tick.
' Please, just say it.
'I can't.
Not to you.
' Why? Because because it's true.
Because it's true, Sherlock.
It's always been true.
Well, if it's true, just say it anyway.
You bastard! 'Say it anyway.
' 'You say it.
Go on.
You say it first.
' - What? - Say it.
Say it like you mean it.
Final 30 seconds.
I .
.
I love you.
I love you.
Molly? Molly, please! I love you.
[BEEPING] [HE EXHALES] Sherlock, however hard that was Eurus, I won.
I won.
Come on, play fair.
The girl on the plane, I need to talk to her.
I won! I saved Molly Hooper! Huh! Saved her? From what? Oh, do be sensible, there were no explosives in her little house.
Why would I be so clumsy? You didn't win, you lost.
Look what you did to her.
Look what you did to yourself.
All those complicated little emotions, I lost count.
Emotional context, Sherlock, it destroys you every time.
Now, please, pull yourself together.
I need you at peak efficiency.
The next one isn't going to be so easy.
In your own time.
- Sherlock? - No.
No! No! No! No! Argh! No! No! No! A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Argh! [THUNDERCLAP] [WIND WHISTLES] Hm-hm.
I know this is difficult, and I know you're being tortured, but you have got to keep it together.
This isn't torture, this is vivisection.
We're experiencing science from the perspective of lab rats.
Huh! - Soldiers? - Soldiers.
[WATSON EXHALES] MORIARTY: 'Tick-tock! Tickets, please!' Hey, Sis, don't mean to complain, but this one's empty.
What happened, did you run out of ideas? It's not empty, Sherlock.
You've still got the gun, haven't you? I told you you'd need it, because only two can play the next game.
Just two of you go on from here.
Your choice, it's make-your-mind-up time.
Whose help do you need the most, John or Mycroft? It's an elimination round.
You choose one and kill the other.
You have to choose, family or friend.
Mycroft or John Watson? 'Tick-tick-tick-tick-tick-tick' - Eurus, enough! - Not yet, I think, but nearly.
Remember, there's a plane in the sky and it's not going to land.
- Well? - Well, what? We're not actually going to discuss this, are we? I'm sorry, Dr Watson, you're a fine man in many respects.
Make your goodbyes and shoot him.
- Shoot him! - What? Shoot Dr Watson.
There's no question who has to continue from here, it's us.
You and me.
Whatever lies ahead requires brainpower, Sherlock, not sentiment.
Don't prolong his agony, shoot him.
Do I get a say in this? Today, we are soldiers.
Soldiers die for their country.
I regret, Dr Watson, that privilege is now yours.
Shit, he's right.
He is, in fact, right.
Make it swift.
No need to prolong his agony.
Get it over with and we can get to work.
Huh! Hm-hm! Oh, God! I should have expected this.
Pathetic.
You always were the slow one.
The idiot.
That's why I've always despised you.
You shame us all.
You shame the family name.
Now, for once in your life, do the right thing.
Put this stupid little man out of all our misery.
Shoot him! - Stop it.
- Look at him.
What is he? Nothing more than a distraction, a little scrap of ordinariness for you to impress, to dazzle with your cleverness.
You'll find another.
- Please, for God's sake, just stop it.
- Why? Because, on balance, even your Lady Bracknell was more convincing.
Ignore everything he just said, he's being kind.
He's trying to make it easy for me to kill him.
Which is why this is going to be so much harder.
You said you liked my Lady Bracknell.
Sherlock, don't.
It's not your decision, Dr Watson.
Not in the face, though, please.
I promised my brain to the Royal Society.
Where would you suggest? Well, I suppose there is a heart somewhere inside me.
I don't imagine it's much of a target, but why don't we try for that? I won't allow this.
This is my fault.
Moriarty.
- Moriarty? - Her Christmas treat.
Five minutes' conversation with Jim Moriarty five years ago.
What did they discuss? Five minutes' conversation unsupervised.
[SHERLOCK SIGHS] Goodbye, brother mine.
No flowers.
My request.
Jim Moriarty thought you'd make this choice.
He was so excited.
'And here we are, the end of the line.
'Holmes killing Holmes.
' 'This is where I get off.
' Five minutes.
It took her just five minutes to do all of this to us.
Well, not on my watch.
What are you doing? A moment ago, a brave man asked to be remembered.
I'm remembering the governor.
- Ten - No! No, Sherlock - nine, eight - You can't! - seven - You don't know about Redbeard yet! - six five - Sherlock! - Sherlock, stop that at once! - [POPPING] four three two GIRL: 'Hello? 'Hello? Are you still there?' Yes, yeah, no, I'm I'm still here.
I'm here.
You went away.
You said you'd help me and you went away.
Yes, I know.
Well, I'm sorry about that.
We we we must have got cut off.
Um How how how long was I away? Hours.
Hours and hours.
Why don't grown-ups tell the truth? No, I-I am telling the truth.
You can trust me.
'Where did you go?' I'm not completely sure.
Um now, I tell you what, you you've got to be really, really brave for me.
Can you go to the front of the plane? Can you do that? - 'The front?' - Yes, that's right, the front.
- 'You mean where the driver is?' - Yes, that's it.
OK.
I'm going.
- Are you there yet? - Yeah, I'm here.
- John? - Yeah? Where are you? I don't know.
I've just woken up.
Where are you? I'm in another cell.
I just spoke to the girl on the plane again.
- We've been out for hours.
- What, she's still up there? Yes.
The plane will keep flying until it runs out of fuel.
Is Mycroft with you? I have no idea, I can hardly see anything.
Mycroft? Mycroft? - Are you OK? - Yeah.
Keep exploring.
Tell me anything you can about where you are.
The walls are rough.
They're rock, I guess.
What are you standing on? Er stone, I think, but, listen, there's about two feet of water.
Chains.
Yeah, my feet are chained up.
I can feel something.
Ah.
Bones, Sherlock.
There are bones in here.
What kind of bones? Er I don't know.
Small.
- Redbeard.
- GIRL: 'Who's Redbeard?' Oh, hello.
Are you at the front of the plane now? Yeah.
I still can't wake the driver up.
That's all right.
What can you see now? I can see a river.
- There's there's there's a big wheel.
- All right.
Well, you and I are going to have to drive this plane together.
Just you and me.
- We are? - Yeah.
There's nothing to it.
We just need to get in touch with some people on the ground.
Now, um can you see anything that looks like a radio? No.
That's all right, but keep looking, we've got plenty of time.
[BLEEPING] - What's wrong? - The whole plane's shaking.
It's just turbulence, it's nothing to worry about.
My ears hurt.
Does the river look like it's getting closer? A little bit.
All right, then, that means you're nearly home.
Sherlock? I'm in a well.
That's where I am.
I'm in the bottom of a well.
Why would there be a well in Sherrinford? Why is there a draft? Walls don't contract after you've painted them.
Not real ones.
I'm home.
Musgrave Hall.
EURUS: 'Me and Jim Moriarty, we got on like a house on fire.
'Which reminded me of home.
' Yeah, it's just an old building, I don't care.
The plane, tell me about the plane now! 'Sweet Jim, he was never very interested in being alive, 'especially if you could make more trouble being dead.
' Yeah, still not interested.
The plane! 'You knew he'd take his revenge.
'His revenge, apparently, is me.
' Eurus, let me speak to the little girl on the plane and I'll play any game you like.
'First, find Redbeard.
' I'm letting the water in now.
You don't want me to drown another one of your pets, do you? At long last, Sherlock Holmes, it's time to solve the Musgrave ritual.
Your very first case, and the final problem.
Oh! Bye-bye.
Sherlock! I that am lost, oh, who will find me deep down below Sherlock! the old beech tree? Help succour me now the east winds blow John! John? Can you hear me?! 16 by six, brother and under we go.
- John?! - Argh! Help me! Help me, please! - Sherlock! - Be not afraid - John? - Yeah, it's flooding.
The well is flooding! - Try as long as possible not to drown.
- What?! I'm going to find you! I am finding you! Well, hurry up, please, because I don't have long! Yargh! It's leaning over! The whole plane! Oh, who will find me Deep down below the old beech tree? Argh! Eurus, you said the answer's in the song, but I went through the song, line by line all those years ago and I found nothing.
I couldn't find anything! There was a beech tree in the grounds and I dug.
I dug, I dug and dug and dug.
16 feet by six.
16 yards, 16 metres, and I found nothing! No-one! Sherlock? It was a clever little puzzle, wasn't it? So, why couldn't you work it out, Sherlock? Sherlock, there's something you need to know.
Emotional context.
And here it comes.
Sherlock, the bones I found Yes.
They're dogs' bones, that's Redbeard.
Mycroft's been lying to you, to both of us.
They're not dogs' bones.
Remember Daddy's allergy? What was he allergic to? What would he never let you have, all those times you begged? Well, he'd never let you have a dog.
[FAINT BARKING] Come on, Redbeard.
Your funny little memory, Sherlock.
You were upset, so you told yourself a better story.
But we never had a dog.
Victor! Now it's coming.
Victor Trevor.
We played pirates.
I was Yellowbeard and he was he was Redbeard! You were inseparable, but I wanted to play, too.
Oh! Oh, God! What what did you do? I that am lost Oh, who will find me Deep down below the old beech tree? Please let me out! Please, someone help me! Please! 'Come on, Redbeard.
' Victor! Deep water, Sherlock, all your life, in all your dreams.
Deep waters.
You killed him! You killed my best friend.
I never had a best friend.
I had no-one.
Play with me, Sherlock.
Play with me.
No-one.
No-one.
OK.
OK, let's play.
GIRL: 'Hello? Are you there?' I need your help.
I'm trying to solve a puzzle.
- 'But what about the plane?!' - The puzzle will save the plane.
The wrong dates.
She used the wrong dates on the gravestones as the key to the cipher, and the cipher was the song.
Is this strictly relevant?! Yes, it is.
I'll be with you in a minute.
The lights are getting closer! Hush now, working.
Let's number the words of the song.
Then rearrange the numbered words to match the sequence on the gravestones.
I am lost.
Help me brother.
Save my life before my doom.
I am lost without your love.
Save my soul, seek my room.
Oh, God! We're going to crash! I'm going to die! Argh! [HE GASPS FOR BREATH] I think it's time you told me your real name.
I'm not allowed to tell my name to strangers.
But I'm not a stranger, am I? I'm your brother.
I'm here, Eurus.
You're playing with me, Sherlock.
We're playing the game.
The game, yes, I get it now.
The song was never a set of directions.
I'm in the plane.
I'm going to crash.
And you're going to save me.
Look how brilliant you are.
Your mind has created the perfect metaphor.
You're high above us, all alone in the sky, and you understand everything except how to land.
Now, I'm just an idiot, but I'm on the ground.
I can bring you home.
No.
No, no.
It's too late now.
No, it's not, it's not too late.
Every time I close my eyes, I'm on the plane.
I'm lost, lost in the sky and no-one can hear me.
Open your eyes.
I'm here.
You're not lost anymore.
[SHE SOBS] Now, you you just, you just went the wrong way last time, that's all.
This time, get it right.
Tell me how to save my friend.
Argh! Eurus, help me save John Watson.
[HE GASPS] I just spoke to your brother.
How is he? He's a bit shaken up, that's all.
She didn't hurt him, she just locked him in her old cell.
What goes around comes around.
Give me a moment, boys.
Um Mycroft, make sure he's looked after.
He's not as strong as he thinks he is.
- Yeah, I'll take care of it.
- Thanks, Greg.
- The helicopter ready? - Mm-hm.
Let's move her, then.
Is that him, sir, Sherlock Holmes? Fan, are you? Well, he's a great man, sir.
No, he's better than that.
He's a good one.
- You OK? - I said I'd bring her home.
I can't, can I? Well, you gave her what she was looking for, context.
Is that good? It's not good, it's not bad, it's It is what it is.
Alive for all these years?! How is that even possible?! What Uncle Rudi began, I thought it best to continue.
I'm not asking how you did it, idiot boy, I'm asking how could you?! - I was trying to be kind.
- Kind?! Kind?! You told us that our daughter was dead! Better that than tell you what she had become.
I'm sorry.
Whatever she became, whatever she is now, Mycroft, she remains our daughter.
And my sister.
Then you should have done better.
He did his best.
Then he's very limited.
Where is she? Back in Sherrinford.
Secure this time.
People have died.
Without doubt, she will kill again if she has the opportunity.
There's no possibility she'll ever be able to leave.
When can we see her? There's no point.
How dare you say that?! She won't talk.
She won't communicate with anyone in any way.
She has passed beyond our view.
There are no words that can reach her now.
Sherlock? Well? You were always the grown-up.
What do we do now? [HE CHECKS TUNING] [HE PLAYS] [MUSIC CONTINUES] [SHERLOCK STOPS PLAYING] [PLAYING RESUMES] [SHERLOCK STOPS PLAYING] [SHE PLAYS THE SAME MELODY] [HE CONTINUES THE MELODY] Er yeah, I-I think you'd better get round here.
[THEY PLAY] PS, I know you two.
And if I'm gone, I know what you could become.
Because I know who you really are.
A junky who solves crimes to get high.
And the doctor who never came home from the war.
Will you listen to me? Who you really are, it doesn't matter.
It's all about the legend.
The stories, the adventures.
There is a last refuge for the desperate, the unloved, the persecuted.
There is a final court of appeal for everyone.
When life gets too strange, too impossible, too frightening, there is always one last hope.
When all else fails, there are two men sitting arguing in a scruffy flat like they've always been there, and they always will.
The best and wisest men I have ever known.
My Baker Street boys.
Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson.
